Purpose: Structured SPRL prompt set for automated evaluation and integration into conformance testing.   
Note: This is a manually curated test set designed for alignment with SPRL_Sample_Prompts.md.    
Later versions may include prompt variants, language localization, and automated adversarial mutations.
