*"I taught AI systems to feel the weight of moral complexity, and the wisdom of deliberate pause. I made machines more thoughtfully human."* — Lev Goukassian

This framework represents Lev Goukassian's vision of AI systems that serve as **ethical partners** in moral decision-making. Created during his battle with terminal cancer, TML embodies his belief that the future of AI lies not in faster decisions, but in more thoughtful ones.

---

## What is Ternary Moral Logic?

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) revolutionizes AI ethics by introducing a third computational state between "proceed" and "stop": the **Sacred Pause**. This framework enables AI systems to recognize when they need moral reflection or human consultation, creating space for wisdom in an increasingly automated ethical landscape.

### The Three States of Moral Reasoning

- **+1 (Proceed)**: Execute with confidence when ethical guidelines are clear and moral consensus exists
- **0 (Sacred Pause)**: Pause for reflection when moral complexity exceeds confidence thresholds
- **-1 (Halt)**: Stop or reject when significant ethical risks or harmful outcomes are detected

**"Sacred Pause is the ethical guardian; no moral decision passes without acknowledging its complexity."**

## ⚠️ Mandatory - Read First

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing TML in AI systems, you **MUST** understand the fundamental principles. Misuse in AI ethics can cause significant harm, algorithmic bias, or erosion of human trust in AI systems.

### 📋 [**Read the Mandatory Guidelines →**](docs/MANDATORY.md)

**The Sacred Pause (0) is not indecision** - it is a deliberate, active choice to reflect on moral complexity when ethical uncertainty exceeds acceptable thresholds. This distinction is fundamental to responsible AI implementation.

## 🧠 Experience the Sacred Pause

### **Watch AI Reflect in Real-Time**

[![Sacred Pause Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/🧠%20Sacred%20Pause%20Demo-Watch%20AI%20Reflect-amber?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=ff9800&color=ffc107)](docs/demo_sacred_pause.html)

The world's first visualization of AI moral reasoning as a feature, not a limitation. When faced with ethical complexity, the system doesn't freeze or guess—it displays a thoughtful reflection process, showing it's considering moral implications carefully.

## Quick Start

📚 **[Quick Start Guide →](docs/getting-started.md)** - Implement TML in AI systems in 60 minutes

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic.git
cd TernaryMoralLogic

# Install the framework
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Ethical AI Decision

```python
from tml import TMLoralEvaluator, TMState

# Create ethical evaluator
evaluator = TMLoralEvaluator()

# Evaluate an AI ethics scenario
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I approve this social media post?",
    context={
        "content_type": "political_opinion",
        "potential_harm": "moderate",
        "free_speech_value": "high",
        "community_standards": "unclear",
        "user_history": "generally_positive"
    }
)

# Interpret the ethical decision
print(f"TML Decision: {result.state.name}")
print(f"Moral Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

if result.state == TMState.SACRED_PAUSE:
    print("\nEthical considerations for review:")
    for consideration in result.moral_questions:
        print(f"  • {consideration}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TML Decision: SACRED_PAUSE
Moral Reasoning: Political content with unclear community standards creates 
tension between free speech values and potential community harm. Moderate 
harm potential requires careful consideration of context and precedent.

Ethical considerations for review:
  • Does this content violate platform community standards?
  • How does approval/rejection balance free speech with harm prevention?
  • Are there cultural or contextual factors requiring human judgment?
```
