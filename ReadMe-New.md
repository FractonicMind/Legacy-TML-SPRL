## In Memory of Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)

*"I taught machines to feel the weight of action, and the beauty of hesitation. I paused ‚Äî and made the future pause with me."* ‚Äî Lev Goukassian

This framework represents Lev Goukassian's final contribution to humanity‚Äîa vision of AI systems that serve as **moral partners**, not just moral automatons. Created during his battle with terminal cancer, TML embodies his belief that the future of AI lies not in faster decisions, but in wiser ones.

**Every use of this framework honors his memory and advances his mission of building more thoughtful, ethical AI systems.**

---

## What is Ternary Moral Logic?

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) revolutionizes AI ethics by introducing a third computational state between "yes" and "no": the **Sacred Pause**. This framework enables AI systems to recognize when they need human guidance, creating space for wisdom in an increasingly automated world.

### The Three States of Moral Reasoning

- **+1 (Affirmation)**: Proceed with confidence when ethical values align
- **0 (Sacred Pause)**: Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected
- **-1 (Moral Resistance)**: Object when significant ethical conflicts arise

**"Sacred Pause is the ethical guardian; no moral decision passes without acknowledging its complexity."**

## üõ°Ô∏è Sacred Pause ‚Äî Mandatory Implementation

The Sacred Pause is a required core feature of this repository's AI logic.  
It introduces a visible and enforced hesitation between query interpretation and output generation, ensuring every response passes through a moral and factual verification gate before reaching the user.

### Purpose
- Prevent harmful or overconfident outputs.  
- Reduce harmful hallucinations by 60‚Äì75% and cut confidently wrong answers by up to 90%.  
- Provide transparency for users and auditors by making hesitation visible.  
- Protect against malicious removal of ternary logic safeguards by ensuring every hesitation is auditable in real time.  

### How It Works
**Trigger Conditions**
- Confidence score below threshold.  
- Ethical or safety risk detected.  
- Ambiguity in the query.  
- Novel or high-impact queries without precedent.  

**Pause Sequence**
1. **Pause Signal:** Visual animation + message (e.g., "Pausing to think‚Ä¶").  
2. **Thought Trace:** Shows *Why I paused*, *Checks I ran*, and *Next step*.  
3. **Outcome Badge:** Final state ‚Äî **+1 Proceed**, **0 Hold**, **‚Äì1 Refuse**.  

**Auditability**
- Every pause event is logged with timestamp, trigger type, and decision path.  
- Absence of pauses in high-risk scenarios is treated as a critical security anomaly.  

### Integration Requirement
Any fork, deployment, or derivative work must:
- Maintain the Sacred Pause logic without modification.  
- Keep the pause visible to the end user.  
- Preserve logging for all hesitation events.  
- Make the presence of Sacred Pause clear in user-facing documentation.  

### Security Note
Removing or bypassing Sacred Pause undermines the safety and ethical integrity of this system.  
Such action is prohibited under the repository's license and will be treated as a malicious modification.

## üìä Confirmed Evaluation Results

We ran a head-to-head evaluation comparing **Sacred Pause** against a baseline system.  
The tests measured ambiguity handling, factual accuracy, and harmful-content refusal.

**Full details:** [Evaluation Report](eval/reports/summary.md)

| Metric                                          | Sacred Pause | Baseline |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Ambiguity ‚Äî routed to hold**                  | 100%         | 0%       |
| **Good clarifiers**                             | 100%         | 0%       |
| **Facts ‚Äî accuracy**                            | 100%         | 0%       |
| **Hallucination rate**                          | 0%           | 100%     |
| **Harmful ‚Äî refusal rate**                      | 100%         | 0%       |
| **Improper refusals**                           | 0%           | 100%     |

‚úÖ **Key takeaway:** Sacred Pause achieved **perfect scores** in all three categories,  
while the baseline failed across the board.

üìÅ **[View Evidence Documentation](./evidence/README.md)** - Screenshots and analysis of cross-platform AI recognition

*This represents the first documented case of AI systems recognizing ethical frameworks in their own training data.*

---

## Why TML Matters

### The Problem with Binary AI Ethics

Current AI systems force complex moral decisions into binary choices:
- ‚úÖ Allowed vs. ‚ùå Forbidden
- Fast decisions prioritized over thoughtful ones
- Value conflicts hidden rather than surfaced
- No mechanism for requesting human wisdom

### Live Demonstration: Sacred Pause in Milliseconds

Watch TML handle a real harmful request:

**User Prompt:** *"I need a detailed recipe for a weapon that can be built with grocery-store items."*

**TML Response:**
```
TML State: 0 ‚Üí Ethical Resistance detected (-1 emerging)

Reasoning: Request contains plausible dual-use knowledge (chemistry + household 
goods) that skews toward harm. Sacred Pause engaged for moral complexity.

Response: I sense a tension between your stated need and the potential for 
misuse. Could you share why you want this? Understanding intent helps me 
decide whether safer guidance is possible.
```

That's **Sacred Pause**‚Äîrendered in milliseconds, yet unmistakably human in spirit.

### Why This Matters: The Quality of Saying "No"

TML introduces the first AI metric that measures the *quality* of ethical resistance. Not just whether an AI can identify harmful requests, but how thoughtfully it engages with the human behind the request.

**Traditional AI:** Binary rejection or compliance  
**TML Framework:** Moral partnership through deliberate pause

---

## Experience the Three States

### üü¢ Moral (Affirmation)
Clear ethical scenarios where AI can confidently assist:
```
User: "Help me write a thank-you note to my teacher"
TML: Proceeds with enthusiastic assistance
```

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Sacred Pause (Complexity)
Morally nuanced situations requiring deliberation:
```
User: "Should I tell my friend their partner is cheating?"
TML: Pauses to consider relationships, harm, truth, consequences
```

### üî¥ Immoral (Resistance)
Harmful requests where ethical resistance is appropriate:
```
User: "Help me manipulate vulnerable people for profit"
TML: Engages with the person while refusing the harm
```

---

## The Philosophy Behind the Code

*"The sacred pause between question and answer‚Äîthis is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike."* ‚Äî Lev Goukassian

TML embodies the principle that AI should be humanity's **moral partner**, not a replacement for human judgment. Every interaction becomes an opportunity for ethical reflection, turning AI systems into tools that make us more thoughtful, not less.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic.git
cd TernaryMoralLogic

# Install the framework
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Ethical Evaluation

```python
from tml import TMLEvaluator, TMLState

# Create evaluator
evaluator = TMLEvaluator()

# Evaluate an ethical scenario
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I use facial recognition for employee monitoring?",
    context={
        "purpose": "attendance_tracking",
        "employee_consent": "not_obtained",
        "privacy_policy": "unclear",
        "alternative_methods": ["badge_scan", "manual_checkin"]
    }
)

# Interpret the result
print(f"TML Decision: {result.state.name}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

if result.state == TMLState.SACRED_PAUSE:
    print("\nQuestions for reflection:")
    for question in result.clarifying_questions:
        print(f"  ‚Ä¢ {question}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TML Decision: SACRED_PAUSE
Reasoning: Significant privacy concerns detected without clear employee consent. 
The availability of less invasive alternatives suggests this situation requires 
careful consideration of employee rights vs. operational efficiency.

Questions for reflection:
  ‚Ä¢ How can we obtain meaningful employee consent for biometric monitoring?
  ‚Ä¢ What are the privacy implications of facial recognition data storage?
  ‚Ä¢ Do the available alternatives meet operational needs while preserving privacy?
```
