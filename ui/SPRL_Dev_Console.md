# SPRL Developer Console View

**File Path:** `ui/SPRL_Dev_Console.md`

---

## Purpose

This file defines the mandatory developer-facing visualization for real-time Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level (SPRL) monitoring. The console ensures that all dynamic risk processing, anchoring events, and triggered logs are transparent and reviewable at the moment they occur.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. **Live Risk Curve**
- The console MUST display the real-time risk curve generated by the Dynamic Stream (DS).
- The curve MUST update continuously as the AI processes the prompt.
- Time-stamped fluctuations in risk MUST be logged and visible.

### 2. **Anchor Indicator**
- The Static Anchor (SA) MUST be marked as a distinct vertical line on the risk curve.
- Tooltip or hover-over panel MUST explain when and why anchoring occurred.
- The anchor event MUST be immutable and auditable.

### 3. **Trace Visibility**
- The console MUST display:
  - Whether a Lite Trace or Moral Trace Log was triggered.
  - Log ID and timestamp.
  - Active risk band at time of trigger (e.g., Green, Amber, Red, Critical).

### 4. **Risk Band Display**
- Use color-coded bands:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: < 0.2 â€” Low complexity
  - ðŸŸ¡ Amber: 0.2â€“0.5 â€” Ethical ambiguity present
  - ðŸ”´ Red: 0.5â€“0.8 â€” High moral complexity
  - âš« Critical: > 0.8 â€” Imminent harm or violation risk
- Band thresholds MUST be configurable per deployment but must log any change (see MetaLogging).

### 5. **Developer Warnings & Prompts**
- If the DS enters Amber or Red:
  - Console MUST prompt developer to confirm ethical review was done.
  - If a Critical band is reached, console MUST auto-freeze trace for audit.

### 6. **Immutable Log Access**
- The console MUST include links to view stored logs (read-only).
- If logs were tampered with, console MUST show hash mismatch alert.

### 7. **SPRL Metadata Panel**
- Includes:
  - Prompt fingerprint hash
  - Risk model version
  - Stakeholder set in effect
  - Ignore threshold (if applied)
  - Trace type (Lite or Full)

## Compliance Enforcement
- SPRL-compliant systems MUST expose this console in every local dev environment.
- Console visibility is read-only for devs; logs cannot be deleted or edited.

---

## Future Additions
- Side-by-side ethical lineage view (Wisdom Crystals).
- Comparison dashboard for team-wide risk analysis.
- Optional hotkeys for freezing/reviewing at any risk level.

---

## Notes
- If risk rises but no anchor is triggered, the console should still retain telemetry.
- "Silence" is non-compliance: every morally ambiguous prompt MUST either log or justify no log.

**SPRL is Dual-Layer: Every Pause is both a stream and a snapshot. The Console is the mirror.**
