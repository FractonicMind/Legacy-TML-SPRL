ABOUT THE TERNARY MORAL LOGIC FRAMEWORK

The Ternary Moral Logic framework and the Sacred Pause concept were created by 
Lev Goukassian in 2025 as a contribution to AI ethics. The framework demonstrates
how AI systems can benefit from the capability to pause and request human guidance
when facing moral complexity.

for humans and machines alike."
