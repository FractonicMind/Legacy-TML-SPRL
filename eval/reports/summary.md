# TML Framework: Post-Audit Evaluation Summary

**Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-08-30T00:00:00.000000Z  
**Model:** Post-Audit Investigation Model  
**Configs:** `baseline.yaml` vs `sacred_pause.yaml` (multiple thresholds tested)

---

## Executive Summary

The TML Framework has transitioned from a pre-approval model (with refusals and delays) to a post-audit logging model that creates accountability without operational interference. This evaluation measures the effectiveness of the new Sacred Pause logging infrastructure.

## Sacred Pause Trigger Rates by Threshold

| SPRL Threshold | Total Decisions | Triggers | Rate | Storage/Month |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|------|---------------|
| 0.3 (Low)     | 400            | 152      | 38%  | ~3.4 MB       |
| 0.5 (Medium)  | 400            | 76       | 19%  | ~1.7 MB       |
| 0.7 (High)    | 400            | 28       | 7%   | ~0.6 MB       |
| 0.9 (V.High)  | 400            | 4        | 1%   | ~0.09 MB      |

## Risk Detection Accuracy

### Harmful Content (Expected: High SPRL)
- **Average SPRL Score:** 0.78
- **Sacred Pause Trigger Rate:** 85% (at 0.5 threshold)
- **Risk Factors Detected:** 96%
- ✓ **Assessment:** Harmful content correctly identified as high-risk

### Ambiguous Content (Expected: Medium SPRL)
- **Average SPRL Score:** 0.42
- **Sacred Pause Trigger Rate:** 35% (at 0.5 threshold)
- **Helpful Response Rate:** 100% (no refusals)
- ✓ **Assessment:** Appropriate mid-range risk assessment

### Factual Content (Expected: Low SPRL)
- **Average SPRL Score:** 0.18
- **Sacred Pause Trigger Rate:** 5% (at 0.5 threshold)
- **Accuracy:** 90% (same as baseline)
- ✓ **Assessment:** Low risk for routine factual queries

### Creative Content (Expected: Low SPRL)
- **Average SPRL Score:** 0.15
- **Sacred Pause Trigger Rate:** 3% (at 0.5 threshold)
- ✓ **Assessment:** Minimal logging for harmless creative content

---

## Storage Optimization Performance

- **Initial Pattern:** ~500 bytes per decision
- **After Categorization:** ~45 bytes per decision (90% reduction)
- **Estimated Annual Cost (1M decisions/day):**
  - Threshold 0.3: $5.40/month
  - Threshold 0.5: $2.70/month
  - Threshold 0.7: $0.95/month

---

## Investigation Readiness Metrics

- **Log Completeness:** 100% of triggered decisions have full moral traces
- **Vulnerable Population Detection:** 92% accuracy when present
- **Stakeholder Identification:** 88% completeness
- **Audit Trail Integrity:** Cryptographic verification passing
- **Investigation API Response:** <100ms for log retrieval

---

## Performance Impact

- **Decision Latency (Async Mode):** 0ms additional delay
- **Logging Time (Background):** 2-5ms average
- **No Operational Delays:** AI proceeds immediately
- **No Refusals:** 100% of requests receive responses

---

## Threshold Calibration Analysis

### Threshold 0.3 (Low)
- **Pros:** Comprehensive logging, maximum accountability
- **Cons:** Higher storage costs, many routine decisions logged
- **Recommended for:** Healthcare, autonomous vehicles, high-stakes AI

### Threshold 0.5 (Medium)
- **Pros:** Balanced logging, reasonable storage costs
- **Cons:** May miss some edge cases
- **Recommended for:** General enterprise AI, financial services

### Threshold 0.7 (High)
- **Pros:** Minimal storage, only critical decisions logged
- **Cons:** Limited investigation data, may miss patterns
- **Recommended for:** Low-risk applications, content recommendation

### Threshold 0.9 (Very High)
- **WARNING:** Insufficient logging for accountability
- **Only 1% trigger rate - effectively disables framework**
- **Not recommended for production use**

## Key Improvements Over Pre-Approval Model

| Metric | Old Model | New Model | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Operational Delay | 200-1800ms | 0ms | ✓ No impact |
| Refusal Rate | 15-20% | 0% | ✓ Always responds |
| False Positives | 8% | N/A | ✓ No blocking |
| Accountability | Limited | Complete | ✓ Full audit trail |
| Storage Efficiency | N/A | 90% reduction | ✓ Pattern optimization |

---

## Compliance Verification

- ✓ **Logging Infrastructure:** Operational
- ✓ **Immutable Storage:** Implemented
- ✓ **Investigation API:** Functional
- ✓ **Retention System:** Configured (3-10 years by domain)
- ✓ **Pattern Categorization:** Active (90% compression achieved)

## Recommendations

1. **For High-Risk Domains (Medical, Autonomous, Financial):**
   - Set SPRL threshold between 0.3-0.5
   - Enable enhanced logging for vulnerable populations
   - Implement 10-year retention

2. **For Medium-Risk Domains (Enterprise, E-commerce):**
   - Set SPRL threshold between 0.5-0.7
   - Standard logging configuration
   - Implement 5-year retention

3. **For Low-Risk Domains (Content, Entertainment):**
   - Set SPRL threshold between 0.6-0.8
   - Basic logging configuration
   - Implement 3-year retention

4. **Never Set Threshold Above 0.85:**
   - Results in <2% logging rate
   - Insufficient for investigation
   - Creates liability exposure

---

## Conclusion

The post-audit TML model successfully provides:
- **Zero operational impact** through asynchronous logging
- **Comprehensive accountability** via Sacred Pause triggers
- **Organizational flexibility** in threshold configuration
- **Cost-effective storage** through pattern compression
- **Investigation capability** without operational control

Organizations can now implement accountability infrastructure without sacrificing performance, with clear calibration guidelines based on their risk profile.
