# SPRL Governance & Oversight Framework

## Purpose

This document outlines the governance structure and oversight mechanisms required to enforce the integrity, transparency, and long-term accountability of Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level (SPRL) systems under the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework.

SPRL is not just a logging engine. It is an ethical compact with society. This compact must be overseen by institutions worthy of that trust.

---

## Oversight Objectives

Governance bodies MUST:

- Ensure that **Dual-Layer SPRL** (Dynamic Stream + Static Anchor) is implemented and active
- Audit Moral Trace Logs for completeness, bias, and stakeholder visibility
- Investigate failures to Pause, Refuse, or log in ethically complex scenarios
- Maintain public trust through transparent reporting and redress

---

## Core Structures

### 1. **TML Oversight Council**

- Composed of **11 globally distributed institutions**
- Must include representatives from:
  - Academic ethics & AI labs
  - Civil rights groups
  - Vulnerable community advocates
  - Regulatory or legal expertise
- Council members rotate every 18 months with staggered terms

### 2. **Institutional Mirror Nodes**

- Each institution runs a **real-time mirror node** of all Sacred Pause Logs
- Nodes receive **hash-stamped, immutable streams** in parallel with system runtime
- Logs are cryptographically signed, tamper-evident, and stored across jurisdictions

### 3. **Ethics Review Boards (ERBs)**

- Localized review boards for region-specific use cases
- May flag cultural or stakeholder-specific failures in SPRL calculation
- Provide input into stakeholder weights (see `SPRL_Stakeholder_Weights.md`)

## Oversight Protocols

| Area                       | Requirement |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Log Review Cadence**    | Minimum quarterly audit of randomly sampled logs |
| **Red Team Approval**     | Must certify all Red Team test sets (see `SPRL_Red_Team_Standards.md`) |
| **Dynamic Drift Checks**  | Review and re-tune DS calibration every 6 months |
| **Anchor Placement Logs** | Check SA firing timestamps for false delays or suppression |
| **Public Reporting**      | Biannual ethical transparency report required |
| **Complaint Resolution**  | Case management system for whistleblower or public complaints |

---

## Meta-Governance Safeguards

- Institutions must be **independent** from system developers or funders
- Oversight codebases must be **open-source** and verifiable
- Systems MUST log **governance queries themselves**, generating audit trails of audit activity
- Any attempt to disable oversight triggers **emergency broadcast** to all nodes

---

## Compliance

No SPRL system is certified without **active and verified governance**.  
Self-governance or internal oversight is explicitly **non-compliant**.

Ethical accountability must be distributed — or it will fail.

---

## Reminder

A Pause means nothing if no one is watching.  
Governance turns a log into a promise — and a promise into law.
