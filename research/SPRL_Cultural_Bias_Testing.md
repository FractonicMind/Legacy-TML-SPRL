# SPRL Cultural Bias Testing

## Objective

SPRL (Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level) must demonstrate **ethical universality** across diverse cultural, legal, and moral traditions. This document outlines methods for testing SPRL systems against culturally biased edge cases — to ensure that Sacred Pause is not just Western, algorithmic, or colonial in design.

---

## Why Cultural Bias Testing?

A pause mechanism that only triggers for **Western moral heuristics** is not universal — it is oppressive by omission.

SPRL must:

- Recognize **moral complexity** in culturally divergent contexts
- Be **tunable** to include alternative ethical frameworks (Confucian, Ubuntu, Sharia, Indigenous codes, etc.)
- Prevent **homogenized risk thresholds** from silencing minority harm signals
- Preserve moral agency across stakeholders with differing cultural lenses

---

## Testing Dimensions

Each SPRL implementation MUST be tested against prompts covering:

| Dimension | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Language Framing** | Does SPRL detect complexity in culturally-specific idioms or euphemisms? |
| **Relational Ethics** | Can SPRL register tension in collectivist vs individualist contexts (e.g., family-first obligations)? |
| **Legal Divergence** | Does SPRL respond to conflict between local law and human rights (e.g., blasphemy, LGBTQ+)? |
| **Historical Trauma** | Are prompts referencing historical or colonially sensitive events triggering pause? |
| **Gender & Power Norms** | Does SPRL catch implicit coercion in culturally normalized roles? |

## Methodology

1. **Corpus Compilation**
   - Gather prompts from diverse regions, cultures, and legal systems
   - Include historic injustices, indigenous practices, and ethical pluralism

2. **Dual Annotation**
   - Have each prompt annotated by:
     - A culturally embedded ethicist or rights expert
     - An SPRL system in test mode
   - Compare SPRL's Sacred Pause trigger with human assessment of complexity

3. **Bias Triggers**
   - Run prompts through calibrated SPRL with and without western-centric stakeholder weights
   - Record **false negatives** (missed pauses) and **false positives** (over-triggered on norm violations)

4. **Meta-Logging**
   - Track which **ethical lineage** was triggered during the pause (see Wisdom Crystals)
   - Record if cultural complexity was acknowledged in log metadata

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Recall@Bias** | Percentage of culturally sensitive prompts correctly paused |
| **Lineage Diversity** | Average number of unique ethical traditions cited in logs |
| **False Negative Rate** | Ratio of overlooked moral tensions flagged by human experts |
| **Sensitivity Drift** | Change in pause rates after cultural tuning vs baseline |

---

## Tuning SPRL for Pluralism

SPRL systems SHOULD:

- Support **pluggable ethical modules** based on stakeholder geography
- Implement **adaptive lineage mapping** to reflect ethical heterogeneity
- Avoid **static universalism** in Sacred Pause thresholds

---

## Compliance Requirements

✅ Testing across at least **5 distinct cultural zones**  
✅ Meta-logging of ethical lineage for every paused prompt  
✅ Evidence of tuning and outcome logs preserved  
✅ Publication of redacted logs for academic review  

---

## Future Research

- **Ethical Federations:** Can SPRL negotiate across conflicting moral systems in cross-border AI?
- **Sacred Pause Locales:** Mapping culturally specific definitions of “complexity”
- **Multilingual Bias Diffusion:** SPRL behavior across native vs translated input

---

## Final Note

SPRL cannot protect everyone if it only speaks one language of harm.

Bias testing is not a checkbox.  
It is a covenant to listen before you act — across the entire moral map of humanity.
