## XII. CONCLUSION

This Succession Invitation Charter ensures the continuation of the Ternary Moral Logic framework and Sacred Pause methodology beyond the lifetime of its creator. By inviting qualified institutions to voluntarily assume stewardship rather than imposing obligations, this framework respects institutional autonomy while protecting the integrity and accessibility of TML for future generations.

The Sacred Pause principle that defines TML—the wisdom to pause and reflect before acting—extends to this succession framework itself. Rather than rushing to assign responsibilities, this Charter creates space for thoughtful consideration and voluntary commitment from institutions that share the vision of ethical AI development.
