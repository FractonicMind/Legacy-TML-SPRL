## I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This Charter establishes succession framework for democratic oversight of the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework and Sacred Pause methodology upon incapacity or death of creator Lev Goukassian. This document invites qualified institutions to assume investigation authority and oversight responsibilities for AI transparency infrastructure.

### Framework Coverage
- **Ternary Moral Logic** transparency infrastructure
- **Sacred Pause** universal logging methodology  
- **TML Investigation Tools** and audit capabilities
- **Democratic Oversight** coordination protocols
- **Memorial Fund** for ethical AI research
- **Academic Collaboration** networks

---

## II. SUCCESSION TRIGGERS

Investigation authority transfer activates upon verified conditions:

1. **Death** of Lev Goukassian (verified by death certificate)
2. **Legal incapacity** (verified by medical/legal documentation)  
3. **Communication absence** (90+ consecutive days non-response)
4. **Voluntary transfer** (written declaration by Lev Goukassian)

Notification sent to Investigation Authority Institutions within 30 days.
