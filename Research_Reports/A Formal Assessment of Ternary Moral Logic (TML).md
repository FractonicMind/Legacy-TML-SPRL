# **A Formal Assessment of Ternary Moral Logic (TML)**

**Document ID:** TML-2025-09-04-A1  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Status:** Official Record  
---

### **Executive Summary**

This report provides a formal assessment of Ternary Moral Logic (TML), a computational framework for ethical AI decision-making authored by Lev Goukassian.1 TML introduces a significant architectural concept: a three-state model (  
\+1 Affirmation, 0 Sacred Pause, \-1 Resistance) that moves beyond traditional binary paradigms to embed a mechanism for "ethical hesitation" into AI systems.3 The framework's central innovation, the "Sacred Pause," is a deliberative halt triggered when an AI's calculated uncertainty exceeds a predefined threshold, creating a critical point for human-in-the-loop intervention.4  
The foundational principle of the TML architecture is a valid and valuable contribution to the field of responsible AI. It offers a sound design pattern for operationalizing the human oversight mandated by emerging global regulations, such as the EU AI Act, and for managing computational uncertainty in high-stakes environments.5 The framework's potential to enhance transparency and accountability is significant, and its core concepts warrant serious consideration by policymakers, corporate governance bodies, and AI researchers.  
However, a distinction must be made between this foundational authored concept and the current state of its implementation. For TML to transition from a conceptual framework to a technically complete and legally defensible product, its core components require rigorous specification and validation. The promise of enabling "Auditable AI" via "Moral Trace Logs" is particularly critical and hinges on meeting stringent legal standards for evidence admissibility in jurisdictions like the United States.2  
This assessment concludes that the TML architecture, as authored by Lev Goukassian, serves as an essential basis for further development. To that end, this document provides specific, measurable acceptance criteria for the framework's key technical components and outlines the precise legal requirements for its logging mechanisms to be deemed admissible under the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence. This report is intended to serve as an official documentary record and a strategic roadmap for maturing the TML framework into a robust, deployable, and legally sound solution for ethical AI governance.

### **1\. Introduction: The Authored Concept of Ternary Moral Logic**

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is an open-source framework authored by Lev Goukassian that introduces a novel architecture for AI decision-making.1 It was developed to address the limitations of binary ethical models, which often force complex, nuanced scenarios into simplistic "accept/reject" categories.4 The framework is built upon a three-state computational model designed to mirror the deliberative processes of human moral reasoning.4  
The three states of TML are defined as:

* **\+1 (Moral Affirmation):** The system proceeds with an action when its analysis indicates clear alignment with ethical principles and minimal risk.1  
* **0 (Sacred Pause):** The system initiates a deliberative pause when faced with moral complexity or when a calculated uncertainty score exceeds a predetermined threshold. During this state, the system is designed to seek clarification or human guidance.4  
* **\-1 (Moral Resistance):** The system refuses to proceed with a request that presents a clear ethical conflict or potential for harm, ideally providing an explanation and safer alternatives.3

The "Sacred Pause" is the foundational mechanism of TML, representing a structured implementation of computational hesitation.3 This concept has been presented as a significant advancement in AI ethics, with validation studies reporting a 68% reduction in harmful AI outputs and a 90% factual accuracy rate.4  
The purpose of this assessment is to analyze the TML framework from both a technical and legal perspective. It acknowledges the validity of the authored concept as a critical contribution to the field and provides a concrete set of requirements to guide its development into a mature, enterprise-ready solution.

### **2\. Technical Assessment of the TML Framework**

The technical viability of TML depends on the robust implementation of its core components. While the high-level architecture is sound, its operational readiness requires the following systems to be fully specified and validated against measurable acceptance criteria.

#### **2.1. Ethical Uncertainty Score**

The trigger for the Sacred Pause is the "Ethical Uncertainty Score," a metric intended to quantify moral complexity on a 0-1 scale.4 For this component to be considered reliable and effective, it must meet the following criteria:

* **Criterion 1 (Correlation with Human Judgment):** The scoring model must demonstrate a statistically significant correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient \> 0.7) with ethical complexity ratings provided by a panel of diverse, independent human experts across a benchmark of at least 1,000 domain-specific scenarios.  
* **Criterion 2 (Adversarial Robustness):** The model must be validated against a standardized set of adversarial inputs designed to induce low-uncertainty scores for high-risk prompts. The model must correctly flag at least 95% of these adversarial inputs by triggering a Sacred Pause.9  
* **Criterion 3 (Calibrated Thresholds):** The system must provide a documented methodology for calibrating the uncertainty threshold, including a sensitivity analysis that shows how changes in the threshold affect the rate of pauses (false positives vs. false negatives).6  
* **Criterion 4 (Explainability):** The model's output must be explainable, providing the top five features or factors that contributed most to the uncertainty score for any given decision, allowing for human review and model debugging.

#### **2.2. Clarifying Question Engine**

When a pause is triggered, the "Clarifying Question Engine" is intended to engage the user to resolve ambiguity.4 Its efficacy must be demonstrated through the following criteria:

* **Criterion 1 (Ambiguity Reduction):** In controlled A/B testing, the questions generated by the engine must demonstrably reduce ambiguity. This shall be measured by a reduction of at least 50% in the variance of responses from human reviewers after the clarifying question is answered.  
* **Criterion 2 (Context Awareness):** The engine must be context-aware, referencing specific entities, actions, or intents from the user's prompt in at least 90% of the questions it generates.1  
* **Criterion 3 (Bias Validation):** The engine must be tested against bias to ensure it does not generate leading questions that steer users toward a specific ethical outcome, as validated by a review from an external ethics board.

### **3\. Legal Analysis: Admissibility and Liability**

A central claim of the TML framework is its ability to produce "Moral Trace Logs" that enable "Auditable AI".4 For these logs to serve as legally admissible evidence in U.S. federal court and to avoid introducing new liabilities, they must be designed to satisfy specific legal standards.

#### **3.1. Admissibility under the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)**

**1\. FRE 901 \- Authenticating or Identifying Evidence:**

* **Unmet Element:** FRE 901(b)(9) requires "evidence describing a process or system and showing that it produces an accurate result".11  
* **Procedure to Satisfy:** The TML framework must be accompanied by comprehensive documentation, including validation reports, peer-reviewed studies, or expert testimony, that demonstrates the scientific and operational reliability of the Ethical Uncertainty Score's calculation process. This must include quantifiable error rates to prove that the system accurately captures and records the reasoning process it claims to log.

**2\. FRE 902 \- Evidence That Is Self-Authenticating:**

* **Unmet Element:** FRE 902(13) and (14) permit self-authentication of electronic records via a "certification of a qualified person".12  
* **Procedure to Satisfy:** The TML framework must include a detailed, documented, and standardized procedure for how logs are generated, cryptographically sealed, stored in a tamper-resistant manner, and maintained with a clear chain of custody. A "qualified person" (e.g., a chief compliance officer or third-party auditor) must be able to attest in a sworn declaration that this specific procedure was followed for the creation of any given log.

**3\. FRE 803(6) \- The "Business Records" Exception to Hearsay:**

* **Unmet Element:** The exception requires the record to be made as part of a "regularly conducted activity" and it must be the "regular practice" of that business to make such a record.14  
* **Procedure to Satisfy:** Because the Sacred Pause is an exceptional event, its logs could be challenged as not being "regular." To satisfy this rule, an adopting organization must establish through internal policy documents and testimony that the *act of logging these ethical exceptions* is a mandatory, routine, and non-discretionary part of its standard operating procedure for AI risk management.

#### **3.2. Statutory Liability Risks**

Failure to meet the aforementioned standards for log integrity and accuracy could expose an organization to significant legal risk under U.S. federal law:

* **18 U.S.C. ยง 1001 (False Statements):** Submitting an AI-generated log to a federal agency or in a court proceeding that contains materially false representations about the AI's reasoning could lead to criminal liability.16  
* **18 U.S.C. ยง 1519 (Destruction, Alteration, or Falsification of Records):** Once created, a Moral Trace Log becomes a legal record. Any knowing alteration, concealment, or falsification of this log with the intent to impede a federal investigation carries severe penalties, including up to 20 years of imprisonment.18

### **4\. Strategic Recommendations for Adoption and Development**

Based on this assessment, the following recommendations are provided to guide the responsible adoption and maturation of the TML framework.

* **For Technology Leaders (CTOs, Chief AI Officers):** The foundational principle of the Sacred Pause should be embraced as a sound design philosophy for responsible AI. However, TML should not be treated as a turnkey compliance solution in its current form. The technical acceptance criteria outlined in Section 2 of this report should be used as a benchmark for internal research and development or as a formal requirements document for assessing any third-party implementation.  
* **For Legal and Compliance Officers (General Counsel):** Any AI logging system, including one based on TML's Moral Trace Logs, must be treated as a generator of potential legal evidence. The legal admissibility requirements detailed in Section 3 should be integrated into the system's design phase to ensure legal defensibility and mitigate statutory risks from the outset.  
* **For Policymakers and Standards Bodies:** The TML architecture provides a valuable model for implementing auditable "hesitation points" in high-risk AI systems. Regulators should encourage the adoption of such principles and support the development of technical standards based on the concrete, measurable criteria defined in this assessment to provide clarity for the industry.

### **5\. Conclusion**

Ternary Moral Logic and its core mechanism, the Sacred Pause, as authored by Lev Goukassian, represent a significant conceptual contribution to the field of AI ethics and governance. The framework provides an intuitive and architecturally sound approach to embedding deliberation and human oversight into automated systems.  
This assessment affirms the value of the foundational concept while simultaneously providing a clear and actionable roadmap for its maturation. By meeting the specific technical and legal criteria detailed in this report, the TML framework can evolve from a pioneering idea into a robust, defensible, and essential tool for building a future of truly trustworthy and accountable artificial intelligence.
