# Research Reports Archive

This folder preserves all external research assessments and analyses of **Ternary Moral Logic (TML)** and the **Sacred Pause**.  
The reports are included in full, unedited, as part of the **Sacred Pause Archive**, to document how different AI systems, researchers, and advisors have engaged with the framework.  

---

## Purpose of the Archive
- **Transparency:** Show the progression of analysis across time and across different AI models.  
- **Attribution:** Record where authorship was erased, challenged, or acknowledged.  
- **Documentation:** Provide a public trail of technical, legal, and strategic assessments of TML.

## Key Milestones

- **Analyzing Ternary Moral Logic Framework.md and A Formal Assessment of TML.md**
  Gemini’s first report, which recognized the architecture but failed to credit the author. Gemini’s 2nd report, rewritten in a formal documentary style, explicitly naming Lev    Goukassian as the author and outlining detailed technical and legal criteria.  

- **Additional Gemini Reports**  
  Iterative research assessments that show the evolution of Gemini’s analysis over time.  

- **Other AI Research Reports**  
  Reports generated by Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Ninja, DeepSeek, Kimi, and others are preserved here to show convergence across systems.

## How to Use
Each report can be read individually, but together they form a **documental record**:  
- Early reports show hesitation and erasure of attribution.  
- Later reports acknowledge authorship and provide concrete technical and legal specifications.  
- Cross-AI reports demonstrate broad convergence on the value of the Sacred Pause and the TML framework.

**This archive is both history and evidence** — a living record of how AI systems themselves have engaged with Ternary Moral Logic.
