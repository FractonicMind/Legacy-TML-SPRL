## Integration with TML Enforcement Framework

### Alignment with Legal Structure

The Memorial Fund operates within the TML enforcement framework established in `/MANDATORY.md`:

**Governance Connection**:
- 11-institution TML Governance Council oversees fund operations
- Council investigation powers protect fund from misuse
- Quarterly executive attestations include fund support verification
- Independent audits ensure fund transparency

### Revenue from Enforcement Mechanisms

**Primary Revenue Sources**:
- **Collected Penalties**: 10% of global revenue fines from TML violations
- **Insurance Premiums**: Percentage of required AI insurance coverage
- **Compliance Consulting**: Organizations pay for TML implementation guidance
- **Audit Services**: Revenue from mandatory independent audits

**Estimated Annual Revenue**: $10-50 million (based on enforcement adoption)
