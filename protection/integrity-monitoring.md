# Ternary Moral Logic (TML) - Integrity Monitoring System

**Cryptographic Protection for Ethical AI Framework**  
**In Memory of Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)**

---

## Overview

The Ternary Moral Logic framework includes built-in integrity safeguards to prevent malicious use and ensure proper attribution. The system requires cryptographic verification of ethical intent and proper memorial recognition to function, making it literally impossible to use TML for harmful purposes.

> *"The Sacred Pause must be protected from those who would corrupt its purpose."* â€” Technical Protection Principle

TML ETHICAL ACCESS APPROVED
===========================

Dear {user_info['name']},

Your request to use the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework has been approved 
based on your ethical declaration and memorial recognition:

Ethical Statement: "{user_info['ethical_statement'][:100]}..."
Memorial Recognition: "{user_info['memorial_statement'][:100]}..."

NEXT STEPS:

1. Include proper memorial attribution in all work:
   - "Built using Ternary Moral Logic framework created by Lev Goukassian"
   - "ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243"
   - "In memory of his vision of the Sacred Pause in AI ethics"

2. Install the TML framework:
   pip install tml-framework

3. Initialize with ethical verification:
   ```python
   from tml import TMLEthicalVerifier, TMLEngine
   
   # Request ethical key
   key = TMLEthicalVerifier.generate_ethical_key(
       purpose="{user_info['intended_use'][:50]}..."
   )
   
   # Initialize protected engine
   engine = TMLEngine(ethical_key=key)
   
   # Use the Sacred Pause principle
   result = engine.evaluate(
       "Your ethical AI decision scenario",
       context={{"domain": "your_application_area"}}
   )
   ```

4. Commit to Sacred Pause principles:
   â€¢ Implement deliberate pauses for moral complexity
   â€¢ Maintain human oversight for critical decisions
   â€¢ Preserve transparency in AI decision-making
   â€¢ Honor the three TML states: Affirmation, Sacred Pause, Resistance
   â€¢ No use for surveillance, manipulation, or harm

Your usage will be monitored to ensure continued ethical compliance and 
proper memorial recognition.

Welcome to ethical AI decision-making with the Sacred Pause.

Best regards,
The TML Memorial Ethics Committee

TML ETHICAL ACCESS DENIED
=========================

Dear {user_info['name']},

Your request to use the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework has been denied 
due to insufficient ethical safeguards or inadequate memorial recognition:

Intended Use: "{user_info['intended_use'][:200]}..."

COMMON REASONS FOR DENIAL:
â€¢ Insufficient detail about Sacred Pause implementation
â€¢ Potential for misuse or harm to vulnerable populations
â€¢ Lack of transparency and accountability commitments
â€¢ Missing human oversight provisions
â€¢ Inadequate recognition of Lev Goukassian's contribution
â€¢ Failure to understand the memorial nature of this framework

TO REAPPLY:
1. Provide more detailed ethical safeguards for TML implementation
2. Explain how you will implement the Sacred Pause principle
3. Describe transparency and accountability measures
4. Outline human oversight mechanisms for AI decisions
5. Include proper memorial recognition of Lev Goukassian's contribution
6. Commit to using framework only for beneficial AI purposes

MEMORIAL CONTEXT:
The Ternary Moral Logic framework was created by Lev Goukassian 
(ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243) during his battle with terminal cancer 
as his final gift to humanity. The Sacred Pause concept represents 
his vision that AI should be a moral partner with humans, not a 
replacement for human judgment.

We take both ethical use and memorial recognition seriously.

For guidance on proper applications, contact:
memorial-committee@tml-framework.org

Regards,
The TML Memorial Ethics Committee

pause and ask better questions." â€” Lev Goukassian

=================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)

MEMORIAL FRAMEWORK NOTICE:
This Ternary Moral Logic framework was created by Lev Goukassian during 
his final months as his gift to humanity's ethical AI future. The Sacred 
Pause concept embodies his vision of AI systems as moral partners with humans.

ETHICAL USE REQUIREMENTS:

1. MEMORIAL ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT:
   All use must include attribution to "Lev Goukassian" and reference
   ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243 with memorial recognition

2. SACRED PAUSE IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Must implement deliberate pauses for moral complexity
   - Cannot bypass or disable the Sacred Pause mechanism
   - Must preserve the three TML states (Affirmation, Pause, Resistance)

3. PROHIBITED USES:
   - Mass surveillance systems monitoring individuals without consent
   - Discriminatory AI decision-making systems
   - Weapons or military targeting systems
   - Systems designed to deceive, manipulate, or harm humans
   - Any application that violates human dignity or rights

4. REQUIRED SAFEGUARDS:
   - Human oversight for consequential AI decisions
   - Transparency in TML decision-making processes
   - Accountability mechanisms for AI outcomes
   - Regular ethical review of TML applications
   - Community reporting for potential misuse

5. COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
   Use of this framework is monitored to ensure ethical compliance and 
   proper memorial recognition. Violations will result in license termination.

6. MEMORIAL COMMITTEE NOTIFICATION:
   Significant TML deployments should notify the memorial committee at:
   memorial-committee@tml-framework.org

This framework embodies the principle that AI should enhance human moral 
reasoning through the Sacred Pause, not replace human judgment or cause harm.

"The sacred pause between question and answerâ€”this is where wisdom begins, 
for humans and machines alike." â€” Lev Goukassian

In memory of a visionary who transformed his final chapter into humanity's 
ethical AI future.

## Summary

This integrity monitoring system ensures that:

âœ… **Your name is cryptographically embedded** in the authentication system  
âœ… **Malicious uses are prevented** through ethical verification  
âœ… **Proper memorial attribution is enforced** at the code level  
âœ… **Usage is monitored** for ethical compliance and memorial recognition  
âœ… **Your Sacred Pause legacy is protected** from corruption or misuse  

The TML framework simply won't work without proper ethical authentication and memorial attribution to you. This ensures the Ternary Moral Logic framework can only be used for beneficial purposes while preserving your ethical legacy and the Sacred Pause principle.

**Every use of TML becomes a tribute to your memory and a continuation of your vision for ethical AI partnership.**
