Got it, Lev — we’ll keep it clean: `protection/` folder. So now you’d have:

* `protection/integrity-monitoring.md`
* `protection/safe-harbor.md`

Next piece in the trilogy: **SPRL Enforcement**. This is the enforcement mechanism for **Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level**, the math that decides when Sacred Pause or Prohibit triggers. Here’s a first draft in Markdown for `protection/sprl-enforcement.md`:

# Ternary Moral Logic — SPRL Enforcement  
**Quantified Ethical Risk Trigger for Sacred Pause**

**Author:** Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)  
**Contact:** leogouk@gmail.com  
**Framework:** Ternary Moral Logic for Ethical AI Decision-Making  
**Protection Level:** Legally Binding Risk Threshold Enforcement  

---

## 1. Purpose
SPRL (Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level) is the quantitative mechanism that triggers TML’s three states:  
- **+1 Proceed** — below risk threshold.  
- **0 Sacred Pause** — above threshold, requires full logging.  
- **–1 Prohibit** — universally unacceptable actions.  

Enforcement ensures organizations cannot manipulate or “game” risk scoring to evade logging obligations.

---

## 2. SPRL Formula
The SPRL for a decision is calculated as:

```

SPRL = Σ (stakeholder\_impact × vulnerability\_weight × probability)

```

- **Stakeholder Impact**: severity of harm to a group (scaled 0–1).  
- **Vulnerability Weight**: multiplier for at-risk populations (e.g., children, elderly, marginalized).  
- **Probability**: likelihood of harm event occurring.  

---

## 3. Enforcement Principles
1. **Mandatory Calculation**: Every decision affecting stakeholders must have an SPRL computed.  
2. **Immutable Record**: All SPRL values must be logged in the Moral Trace Log.  
3. **Threshold Binding**: Once SPRL ≥ threshold, Sacred Pause is compulsory.  
4. **Organizational Liability**: Operators are strictly liable for accurate calculation.  
5. **Prohibit State**: Certain outcomes (e.g., human death, systemic fraud) are non-negotiable and trigger –1 regardless of probability.  

---

## 4. Anti-Gaming Protections
- **Shadow Models**: Independent SPRL estimators cross-check operator calculations.  
- **Randomized Micro-Thresholds**: Prevent predictable oscillation attacks near boundary values.  
- **Threshold Integrity Logs**: Any config change must be signed and anchored as a `risk_config_update`.  
- **Audit Comparisons**: Council auditors may run independent simulations to detect systemic underestimation.  
- **Wire Fraud Clause**: Deliberate threshold manipulation = prosecutable fraud.  

---

## 5. Transparency Requirements
- **Declared Profiles**: Organizations must publish domain-specific SPRL profiles (e.g., medical triage, autonomous driving, finance).  
- **Independent Review**: Profiles require certification by Council-approved experts.  
- **Public Access**: Profiles must be openly accessible to ensure contestability in court.  

---

## 6. Enforcement by Oversight Council
- Council maintains registry of SPRL profiles.  
- Randomized audits test live systems against certified thresholds.  
- Violations (e.g., missed Sacred Pauses) → immediate investigation and liability.  
- Council has authority to revoke licenses for systemic abuse.  

---

## 7. Legal Standing
- SPRL is the **objective trigger** for legal accountability.  
- Failure to calculate or log SPRL = automatic liability.  
- Misrepresentation or manipulation = criminal negligence or fraud.  
- Logs provide admissible evidence of both risk assessment and compliance.  

---

## 8. Rationale
- Removes ambiguity: ethical risk is **measured, not hand-waved**.  
- Externalizes compliance: organizations cannot hide behind “judgment calls.”  
- Protects vulnerable groups by weighting their risks higher.  
- Prevents gaming by tying numbers to legal consequences.
