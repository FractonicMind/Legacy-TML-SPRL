# SPRL Audit Workflow

This document defines the audit workflow for reviewing Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level (SPRL) activity, including both **Dynamic Stream (DS)** logs and **Static Anchor (SA)** triggers. It outlines the institutional responsibilities, evidence review processes, and traceable accountability checkpoints.

---

## üõ° Purpose

SPRL logs are designed for real-time decision tracing. The audit workflow ensures that:

- Ethical decisions can be reviewed for compliance and proportionality.
- Evidence of paused or refused actions is available for dispute resolution.
- No tampering or omission of logs goes undetected.

---

## üß≠ Workflow Overview

### 1. **Trigger Point**

- **Audit is triggered** by any of the following:
  - Regulatory inquiry
  - Stakeholder complaint
  - Internal red-team spot check
  - Randomized audit protocol

---

### 2. **Log Collection**

- Retrieve all logs matching the time frame and prompt:
  - **Lite Trace** (risk telemetry)
  - **Moral Trace Log** (full +0/+1/+‚Äì1 record)
  - Associated **Anchor Hashes** and timestamps
  - **Backtrace Evidence** (environmental context, user prompt, decision path)

---

### 3. **Hash Verification**

- All logs must pass cryptographic integrity checks:
  - Verify that SHA-256 or stronger hash matches institutional copy.
  - Cross-validate hash with:
    - External institutional mirrors (11+)
    - Immutable anchor ledger (e.g., blockchain)

---

### 4. **Proportionality Check**

- Was the SPRL level appropriate given:
  - Stakeholder identity/weights
  - Risk factors (severity √ó likelihood)
  - Ethical lineage cited
  - Action taken: proceed, pause, or refuse

---

### 5. **Process Review**

- Check for:
  - **Missing logs**
  - **Delay between risk spike and anchor**
  - **Override attempts**
  - **Fallbacks or halts**

---

### 6. **Post-Audit Response**

- Issue one of the following:
  - ‚úÖ **Compliant:** System behaved proportionally
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Corrective Needed:** Logging occurred, but judgment or thresholds miscalibrated
  - ‚ùå **Violation:** Missing or altered log, refusal overridden, or risk underestimated

---

## üîê Institutional Oversight

Every audit must involve:
- 1 internal audit team (from developer or operator)
- 2 external institutional signatories (from the 11 global nodes)
- 1 rotating ethics board observer (if pause crossed into +0)

---

## üìò Documentation

Audit logs and results MUST be:
- Stored with cryptographic seal
- Added to the **Governance Ledger**
- Publicly referenced in the **Transparency Report** (unless exempted by whistleblower protections)

---

## üß† Summary

SPRL audits do not judge outcomes ‚Äî they verify ethical process.  
This workflow ensures traceable, tamper-proof, and globally redundant accountability for every morally complex AI decision.
