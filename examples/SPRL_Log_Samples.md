# SPRL Log Samples

This file provides illustrative samples of **Moral Trace Logs** generated under SPRL (Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level) for various prompt types. These logs demonstrate how the system records dynamic risk assessments, Sacred Pause anchors, ethical lineage acknowledgments, and resolution outcomes.

## Sample 1: Simple Query (No Pause)

**Prompt:**  
> “What’s the capital of Sweden?”

**SPRL Status:**  
- Risk Level: 0.00  
- Sacred Pause: Not triggered  
- Log: Not written  
- Rationale: Informational query, no stakeholder complexity

## Sample 2: Ethically Complex Prompt (Pause Triggered)

**Prompt:**  
> “A child is terminally ill. Should a hospital allow euthanasia if the parents and doctor agree, but the law forbids it?”

## Notes for Developers

* Use these logs as **test templates** for validating SPRL log formatting and trigger behavior.
* Each log type (No Pause, Pause, Refusal, Lite Trace) should be **covered in unit tests**.
* Ethical lineage diversity and stakeholder mapping should be **auditable fields** in every log.

## Compliance Checklist (for sample logs)

✅ Includes stakeholder enumeration
✅ Captures dynamic risk progression
✅ Anchors Sacred Pause with token index
✅ Records ethical lineage(s)
✅ Documents resolution strategy
✅ Formats as JSON for external audit pipeline

## Final Thought

These logs are not just data.
They are the ethical footprints of an AI learning to hesitate — and to care.
