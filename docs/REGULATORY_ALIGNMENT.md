# TML Regulatory Alignment Framework

**Creator**: Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Purpose**: Mapping TML enforcement mechanisms to existing regulatory frameworks

---

## Executive Summary

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) addresses the implementation gap in current AI regulations by providing concrete technical mechanisms for abstract compliance requirements. While existing frameworks establish principles, TML specifies exactly how to generate court-admissible evidence, reverse burden of proof, and create enforceable accountability.

**Core Value Proposition**: TML transforms regulatory compliance from vague guidelines into precise technical specifications with criminal and financial enforcement.

## EU AI Act Alignment

### Current EU AI Act Requirements
- **Article 13**: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity requirements
- **Article 14**: Human oversight and transparency obligations  
- **Article 15**: Quality management systems
- **Article 16**: Record-keeping requirements for high-risk systems

### TML Implementation of EU Requirements

**Article 13 - Accuracy and Robustness**:
```python
# TML provides concrete accuracy measurement
def eu_accuracy_compliance(ai_decision, context):
    sprl = tml.calculate_sprl(ai_decision, context)
    
    # Document accuracy assessment
    accuracy_trace = {
        "decision_confidence": ai_decision.confidence,
        "uncertainty_factors": sprl.uncertainty_components,
        "robustness_score": sprl.reversibility_factor,
        "bias_assessment": sprl.stakeholder_impact
    }
    
    return tml.store_eu_compliance_record(accuracy_trace)
```

**Article 14 - Human Oversight**:
- Sacred Pause generates evidence requiring human investigation when thresholds exceeded
- Council institutions provide structured human oversight authority
- Investigation access enables meaningful human review of AI decisions
- Immutable logs prevent circumvention of oversight requirements

**Article 15 - Quality Management**:
- SPRL methodology provides systematic quality assessment
- Quarterly executive attestations under criminal penalty
- Independent audit requirements with lottery selection
- Continuous bias monitoring and correction protocols

**Article 16 - Record-keeping**:
- Universal logging for all AI interactions above thresholds
- Cryptographically signed immutable records
- Blockchain anchoring for long-term integrity
- Investigation access protocols for regulatory authorities

### TML Advantages Over EU AI Act Compliance

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- EU AI Act: Administrative fines and compliance orders
- TML: Criminal penalties and irrebuttable legal presumptions

**Evidence Standards**:
- EU AI Act: General record-keeping requirements  
- TML: Court-admissible evidence with cryptographic integrity

**Investigation Capability**:
- EU AI Act: Regulatory assessment authority
- TML: Post-incident investigation with expert analysis

## GDPR Article 22 Implementation

### Current GDPR Requirements
**Article 22**: Right not to be subject to automated decision-making without explanation

### TML Solution for GDPR Compliance

**Automated Decision Transparency**:
```python
def gdpr_explanation_compliance(automated_decision):
    # Generate comprehensive explanation
    moral_trace = tml.generate_moral_trace(
        decision=automated_decision,
        stakeholder_analysis=identify_data_subjects,
        processing_logic=explain_algorithm_reasoning,
        risk_assessment=calculate_individual_impact
    )
    
    # Provide individual-accessible explanation
    gdpr_explanation = {
        "decision_reasoning": moral_trace.ethical_analysis,
        "data_used": moral_trace.stakeholder_data,
        "algorithmic_logic": moral_trace.processing_steps,
        "individual_impact": moral_trace.personal_consequences,
        "contest_mechanism": investigation_access_protocol
    }
    
    return gdpr_explanation
```

**TML Advantages for GDPR**:
- Systematic explanation generation for all automated decisions
- Individual access to reasoning documentation through investigation protocols
- Immutable records preventing post-hoc explanation manipulation
- Legal presumptions protecting individual rights when logs missing

## US Regulatory Framework Integration

### SOX-Style Financial Accountability
**TML Executive Attestation** mirrors Sarbanes-Oxley requirements:
- Quarterly CEO/CTO certification under penalty of perjury
- Personal criminal liability for false attestation
- Independent audit requirements
- Whistleblower protection with financial rewards

**Implementation for AI Systems**:
```python
def quarterly_ai_attestation():
    return {
        "logs_complete": verify_complete_moral_trace_logs(),
        "thresholds_accurate": validate_sprl_implementation(),
        "no_retaliation": confirm_whistleblower_protection(),
        "insurance_maintained": verify_victim_coverage(),
        "executive_certification": sign_under_perjury()
    }
```

        decision=credit_decision,
        protected_characteristics=applicant_data.demographics,
        adverse_impact_analysis=True
    )
    
    # Enhanced logging for credit decisions
    if affects_protected_class(applicant_data):
        return tml.generate_enhanced_moral_trace(
            decision_factors=credit_decision.reasoning,
            bias_assessment=sprl.discrimination_risk,
