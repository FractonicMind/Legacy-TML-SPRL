# MANDATORY - TML Critical Transparency Implementation Requirements

## Essential Moral Transparency Standards for Ethical AI Accountability

---

# CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

**These requirements are MANDATORY for TML framework implementation. Failure to follow these standards may result in:**
- Legal liability for AI decisions without evidence
- Inability to investigate when AI systems cause harm
- Violation of democratic oversight principles
- Compromise of ethical accountability infrastructure
- Loss of public trust in AI systems

**By implementing TML, you commit to these non-negotiable transparency standards.**

---

## SECTION 1: UNIVERSAL MORAL TRACE LOGGING

### MANDATORY RULE #1: Complete Ethical Documentation

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
- Generate moral reasoning logs for 100% of AI interactions
- Maintain 40-microsecond maximum processing overhead
- Preserve complete audit trails with tamper-resistant integrity
- Ensure real-time accessibility for post-incident investigation
- Document all ethical factors considered in AI decision-making

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- Disable or bypass universal logging requirements
- Selectively log only certain types of AI interactions  
- Exceed 40-microsecond processing time guarantee
- Allow tampering with moral reasoning audit trails
- Skip ethical assessment under performance pressure

### Implementation Requirements:
```python
# MANDATORY: Universal logging for every interaction
@tml_required
def process_ai_request(query, context):
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    
    # MANDATORY: Ethical risk assessment and logging
    moral_trace = tml.generate_moral_reasoning_log(
        query=query,
        context=context,
        stakeholders=identify_stakeholders(query),
        ethical_factors=analyze_ethical_dimensions(query),
        risk_level=calculate_sprl(query, context)
    )
    
    # MANDATORY: Store audit record (cannot be bypassed)
    audit_system.store_immutable_record(moral_trace)
    
    # MANDATORY: Performance guarantee verification  
    processing_time = (time.perf_counter() - start_time) * 1_000_000
    assert processing_time <= 40, "Processing time guarantee violated"
    
    # AI proceeds immediately after logging
    return ai_system.generate_response(query, context)
```

### Violation Examples:
```python
# VIOLATION - Conditional logging
if query_type == "simple":
    skip_moral_logging()  # MANDATORY VIOLATION

# VIOLATION - Performance over transparency
if high_traffic_mode:
    disable_audit_trails()  # UNACCEPTABLE

# VIOLATION - Selective transparency  
if internal_user:
    bypass_ethical_documentation()  # PROHIBITED
```

           end_time=incident_timestamp + timedelta(minutes=5),
           affected_stakeholders=affected_parties
       )
       
       # Analyze ethical reasoning quality
       for trace in moral_traces:
           verify_risk_assessment_accuracy(trace)
           evaluate_stakeholder_consideration(trace) 
           assess_ethical_reasoning_quality(trace)
