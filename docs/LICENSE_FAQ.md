# Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework - LICENSE FAQ

## Legal and Usage Guidelines for the TML Framework

---

## Core License Questions

### Q1: What license governs the TML Framework?
**A:** The TML Framework is released under the standard **MIT License**, one of the most permissive open-source licenses. This allows free use, modification, and distribution for both commercial and non-commercial applications, with minimal restrictions.

### Q2: Can I use TML in commercial AI systems?
**A:** **Yes, absolutely.** TML can be integrated into commercial AI products, consulting services, and enterprise systems without paying royalties or seeking permission. The Sacred Pause capability can enhance your systems when contextually appropriate.

### Q3: What are my obligations when using TML?
**A:** Your only legal obligations under the MIT License are:
1. **Include the original copyright notice** and license text in any substantial distribution
2. **Acknowledge Lev Goukassian's authorship** when presenting TML concepts publicly
3. **The software is provided "AS IS"** without warranty

### Q4: Can I create proprietary AI tools based on TML?
**A:** **Yes.** You can build proprietary assessment tools, reasoning engines, and decision-making systems using TML. The MIT License explicitly permits creating derivative works that you keep proprietary. The original TML attribution must be retained.

### Q5: Do I need permission to teach TML in academic courses?
**A:** **No permission needed.** TML is freely available for educational use. We encourage integration into AI ethics curricula, student projects, and academic research.

## Commercial and Enterprise Use

### Q6: Can consulting firms charge for TML implementation services?
**A:** **Yes.** Consulting firms can charge for TML integration, develop proprietary methodologies, create training programs, and offer services. The framework itself remains free; you're charging for your expertise.

### Q7: Can I trademark an AI product name that uses TML?
**A:** **Yes, with clarification:** You can trademark your product/service names (e.g., "EthicalAI Proâ„¢"). However, "Sacred Pause" was created by Lev Goukassian in 2025 and should be attributed to him when using the concept.

### Q8: What about patent applications for TML-based innovations?
**A:** You may patent **specific novel implementations** or **technical improvements** you develop using TML. The core Sacred Pause concept remains free for all to use with proper attribution.

### Q9: Can government agencies implement TML in public AI systems?
**A:** **Yes.** Government use is permitted for public sector AI governance, regulatory compliance systems, and ethical review processes. No special license is required.

### Q10: Are there geographic restrictions on TML use?
**A:** **No.** TML is available worldwide without restrictions. The framework supports global AI ethics implementation while respecting cultural variations.

## Implementation and Modification

### Q11: Can I modify the Sacred Pause implementation?
**A:** **Yes.** The MIT License allows full modification. You can adapt Sacred Pause thresholds, change triggering conditions, or create alternative implementations based on your specific needs.

### Q12: What if I want to remove Sacred Pause features?
**A:** **Permitted.** While Sacred Pause is a valuable capability for handling moral complexity, you're free to use other parts of TML without it, or modify it to suit your requirements.

### Q13: Can I combine TML with other frameworks?
**A:** **Yes.** TML is designed to be interoperable. It can complement IEEE standards, Asilomar AI Principles, and corporate governance frameworks.

### Q14: Do I need to contribute improvements back?
**A:** **Not required but appreciated.** While you can keep modifications proprietary, sharing improvements benefits the entire community.

### Q15: Are there any restricted use cases?
**A:** **No.** The standard MIT License imposes no use restrictions. Organizations determine appropriate applications based on their own ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements.

## Attribution and Academic Use

### Q16: How should I cite TML in academic papers?
**A:** Use this citation format:
```
Goukassian, L. (2025). Ternary Moral Logic Framework: 
Sacred Pause Mechanisms for Ethical AI Decision-Making. 
https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic
ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243
Sacred Pause created by Lev Goukassian, 2025
```

### Q17: Can I publish research extending or critiquing TML?
**A:** **Yes.** Academic freedom is fundamental. You can publish papers, develop alternatives, propose improvements, and conduct validation studies. Proper attribution is appreciated.

### Q18: Can I use TML in competitive research grants?
**A:** **Yes.** You can include TML in grant proposals, claim novel applications as your contribution, and compete for funding with TML-based projects.

### Q19: Can I create a "fork" with different principles?
**A:** **Yes.** The MIT License allows creating modified versions for different moral frameworks or domain-specific systems. Consider using a different name to avoid confusion.

### Q20: Do I need to share my TML research data?
**A:** **Not required.** While you own your research data, sharing advances the field and helps improve the framework for everyone.

## Financial and Sustainability Questions

### Q21: Will TML ever become paid software?
**A:** **No.** The MIT License is irrevocable for all released versions. Once released under MIT, it remains free forever.

### Q22: Can I donate to support TML development?
**A:** Currently, there is no formal donation mechanism. The framework is Lev Goukassian's contribution to the field. Community contributions through code and research are welcomed.

### Q23: Can someone claim exclusive TML rights?
**A:** **No.** Any such claims would be invalid. The MIT License ensures TML remains freely available to all. The Sacred Pause concept was created by Lev Goukassian in 2025 and this attribution should be maintained.

### Q24: Can I create a commercial TML certification program?
**A:** **Yes.** You can offer paid certification, training, and consulting. Be transparent that yours is not the "only" or "official" certification.

### Q25: Is there a TML trademark or logo?
**A:** No official trademark exists. You may create your own visual representations for your implementations while maintaining proper attribution to Lev Goukassian as creator of Sacred Pause.
