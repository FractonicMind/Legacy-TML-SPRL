##  Ethical Obligations and Misuse Prevention

### Q11: Can I remove Sacred Pause safety features in my implementation?
**A:** **Legally yes, ethically no.** While the MIT License allows modification, removing Sacred Pause safety mechanisms contradicts TML's fundamental purpose. Such modifications:
- Undermine AI safety objectives
- May create liability risks in AI deployment
- Violate the memorial intent of the framework
- Could harm vulnerable populations affected by AI decisions

### Q12: What constitutes misuse of the TML Framework?
**A:** Misuse includes:
- __Removing ethical safeguards__ while still claiming TML compliance
- __Using TML to create deceptive "ethics washing"__ for harmful AI
- __Implementing discriminatory AI__ under the guise of moral reasoning
- __Weaponizing AI systems__ using TML components
While legally permitted under MIT License, such uses violate the framework's ethical foundation.

### Q13: Can I use TML to justify unethical AI decisions?
**A:** **Absolutely not.** TML is designed to **prevent** unethical AI decisions through Sacred Pause reflection. Using it to rationalize predetermined harmful outcomes is:
- A fundamental misunderstanding of the framework
- Potentially legally liable depending on jurisdiction
- A violation of professional AI ethics standards

### Q14: What if someone uses TML for harmful AI applications?
**A:** The TML community response includes:
1. **Public documentation** of misuse cases
2. **Community advisory warnings** about bad actors
3. **Technical countermeasures** in future versions
4. **Collaboration with AI safety organizations**
Report suspected misuse to: support@tml-goukassian.org

### Q15: Are there any "MANDATORY" implementation requirements?
**A:** While not legally required, **MANDATORY.md** contains critical safety guidelines that all ethical implementers should follow:
- Never bypass Sacred Pause in high-stakes decisions
- Always maintain human oversight capabilities
- Document moral reasoning transparency
- Preserve appeal and review mechanisms
