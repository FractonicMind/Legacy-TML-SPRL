## Ethical Obligations and Infrastructure Protection

### Q11: Can I modify TML transparency requirements in my implementation?
**A:** **Legally yes, ethically discouraged.** While the MIT License allows modification, reducing transparency infrastructure contradicts TML's fundamental purpose. Such modifications:
- Undermine AI accountability objectives
- May create liability risks in AI deployment where transparency is expected
- Violate the democratic oversight intent of the framework
- Could prevent investigation when AI decisions cause harm

### Q12: What constitutes misuse of the TML transparency infrastructure?
**A:** Misuse includes:
- **Implementing selective logging** while claiming universal TML transparency
- **Using TML branding for "ethics washing"** without substantive accountability
- **Circumventing audit trail generation** while maintaining TML compliance claims
- **Preventing investigation access** when incidents require evidence analysis
While legally permitted under MIT License, such uses violate the framework's transparency foundation.

### Q13: Can I use TML to justify inadequate AI transparency?
**A:** **Absolutely not.** TML is designed to **mandate comprehensive AI transparency** through universal logging. Using it to rationalize selective disclosure or limited audit capability is:
- A fundamental misunderstanding of the transparency infrastructure
- Potentially legally liable depending on jurisdiction and regulatory requirements
- A violation of professional AI ethics and accountability standards

### Q14: What if someone uses TML branding for non-transparent AI applications?
**A:** The TML community response includes:
1. **Public documentation** of transparency circumvention cases
2. **Community advisory warnings** about inadequate implementations  
3. **Technical verification tools** for authentic TML transparency
4. **Collaboration with AI accountability organizations**
Report suspected transparency violations to: transparency-violations@tml-goukassian.org

### Q15: Are there any implementation requirements for authentic TML transparency?
**A:** While not legally required, authentic TML implementation should follow transparency standards:
- Universal moral trace logging for 100% of AI interactions
- 40-microsecond maximum processing time guarantee
- Complete audit trail accessibility for investigation
- Consortium institution coordination for democratic oversight
