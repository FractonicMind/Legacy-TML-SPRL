## Research Ethics Overview

### Research Purpose and Scope

The TML framework represents a novel approach to AI ethics that introduces a three-state moral reasoning system (Moral, Immoral, Sacred Pause) to address limitations in current binary ethical frameworks. This research aims to:

1. **Develop** a philosophically grounded framework for AI moral reasoning
2. **Validate** the framework across multiple domains (medical, automotive, financial, content moderation)
3. **Ensure** ethical safeguards prevent misuse of the technology
4. **Preserve** the memorial legacy of the framework creator

### Ethical Principles Governing Research

**Beneficence**: The research is designed to benefit humanity by improving AI decision-making in morally complex scenarios.

**Non-maleficence**: Comprehensive safeguards prevent harmful applications of the framework.

**Justice**: The framework promotes fairness and prevents discrimination in AI systems.

**Autonomy**: The Sacred Pause principle preserves human agency and oversight in AI decisions.

**Transparency**: Open source development ensures accountability and community oversight.
