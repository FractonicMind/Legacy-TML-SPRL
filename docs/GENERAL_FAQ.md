## Understanding TML Basics

### Q1: What is the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework?
**A:** TML is an AI ethics framework that introduces a third state - **Sacred Pause** (created by Lev Goukassian, 2025) - between binary proceed/stop decisions. TML provides AI systems with the capability to acknowledge moral complexity and request enhanced review when appropriate for the specific context.

### Q2: What is the Sacred Pause?
**A:** The **Sacred Pause** is TML's signature innovation - a capability for deliberate suspension of AI decision-making when organizations determine it would be valuable, such as when:
- Moral complexity exceeds configured thresholds
- Competing ethical principles create dilemmas
- Potential impacts require additional consideration
- Novel situations lack precedent
- Human consultation would improve outcomes

Organizations can configure when and how to use this capability.

### Q3: How does TML differ from traditional AI ethics approaches?
**A:** TML uniquely provides:
- **Acknowledgment of moral uncertainty** as a valid computational state
- **Prevention of premature conclusions** when configured
- **Explicit handling capabilities** for edge cases
- **Traceable decision paths** for audit purposes
- **Options for human involvement** in significant decisions

### Q4: Why "Ternary" instead of continuous ethics scores?
**A:** While continuous scores (0.0-1.0) seem more nuanced, TML's three states can provide clearer decision boundaries:
- **PROCEED (1)** Clear permission based on configured criteria
- **SACRED PAUSE (0)** Uncertainty handling when enabled
- **STOP (-1)** Clear prohibition based on configured criteria

Organizations choose how to implement these states.

### Q5: What types of AI systems benefit most from TML?
**A:** TML can be valuable for:
- **Healthcare AI** Where careful consideration improves outcomes
- **Autonomous systems** When fallback protocols are needed
- **Financial AI** For fairness and bias considerations
- **Content moderation** Balancing multiple interests
- **HR systems** Supporting equitable decisions
- Any AI where moral complexity matters to the organization

## Technical Implementation

### Q6: How do I implement Sacred Pause in my AI system?
**A:** Basic implementation pattern:

```python
from tml_framework import TMLEngine, MoralContext

# Initialize with your configuration
tml = TMLEngine(
    domain="healthcare",
    sacred_pause_enabled=True,  # Optional capability
    threshold=0.7  # Adjust to your needs
)

# Evaluate based on your context
context = MoralContext(
    action="treatment_recommendation",
    stakeholders=["patient", "family", "insurance"],
    potential_outcomes=outcomes_data
)

decision = tml.evaluate(context)

# Handle according to your protocols
if decision.state == "SACRED_PAUSE":
    # Your chosen review process
    handle_pause(decision.reasoning)
elif decision.state == "PROCEED":
    execute_action(decision.confidence)
else:  # STOP
    log_prohibition(decision.concerns)
```

### Q7: What are the computational requirements for TML?
**A:** TML is designed to be lightweight:
- **Memory** ~10MB for core engine
- **CPU** Minimal overhead (<1% typical)
- **Latency** Usually <100ms for evaluation
- **Storage** Based on your audit requirements
- **Scalability** Handles high-volume decisions

The Sacred Pause capability adds minimal overhead when used.

### Q8: Can TML work with existing ML/AI frameworks?
**A:** Yes, TML integrates with:
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** As an evaluation layer
- **Scikit-learn** For decision validation
- **Hugging Face** For LLM integration
- **Cloud platforms** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
- **Edge computing** Lightweight implementations

Example integrations provided in `examples/integrations/`.

### Q9: How do I set Sacred Pause thresholds?
**A:** Thresholds are configurable based on your needs:

```python
# Example configuration - adjust to your context
thresholds = {
    "moral_complexity": 0.7,      # Your complexity tolerance
    "stakeholder_conflict": 0.6,   # Your conflict threshold
    "novel_situation": 0.8,        # Your precedent requirements
    "potential_harm": 0.5,         # Your risk tolerance
    "reversibility": 0.4           # Your reversibility needs
}
```

Calibrate based on your domain and requirements.

### Q10: What happens during a Sacred Pause?
**A:** Organizations can define their own Sacred Pause protocols:

1. **Logging**: Record pause reason and context
2. **Notification**: Alert relevant parties (if desired)
3. **Enhancement**: Gather additional information (optional)
4. **Review**: Your chosen evaluation process
5. **Decision**: Resolution based on your procedures
6. **Learning**: Optional system updates

Process can be synchronous or asynchronous based on needs.
