# Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework - GENERAL FAQ

## Technical and Practical Implementation Guide for AI Ethics


---

## 🎯 Understanding TML Basics

### Q1: What is the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework?
**A:** TML is a revolutionary AI ethics framework that adds a crucial third state - **Sacred Pause** - between binary proceed/stop decisions. Instead of forcing immediate ethical judgments, TML allows AI systems to acknowledge moral complexity and defer to enhanced review when ethical clarity is insufficient.

### Q2: What is the Sacred Pause?
**A:** The **Sacred Pause** is TML's signature innovation - a deliberate suspension of AI decision-making when:
- Moral complexity exceeds clear evaluation thresholds
- Competing ethical principles create genuine dilemmas
- Potential harm to vulnerable populations is detected
- Novel ethical situations lack precedent
- Human values and AI optimization conflict

This pause triggers enhanced ethical review, stakeholder consultation, or human intervention.

### Q3: How does TML differ from traditional AI ethics approaches?
**A:** Traditional approaches often force binary ethical decisions or use continuous probability scores. TML uniquely:
- **Acknowledges moral uncertainty** as a valid state
- **Prevents premature ethical conclusions** in complex scenarios
- **Mandates explicit handling** of edge cases
- **Creates traceable decision paths** for audit
- **Preserves human agency** in morally significant decisions

### Q4: Why "Ternary" instead of continuous ethics scores?
**A:** While continuous scores (0.0-1.0) seem more nuanced, they create false precision in moral reasoning. TML's three states reflect ethical reality:
- **PROCEED (1)**: Clear ethical permission with confidence
- **SACRED PAUSE (0)**: Genuine moral uncertainty requiring deeper consideration
- **STOP (-1)**: Clear ethical prohibition with confidence

This prevents "ethics washing" through probability manipulation.

### Q5: What types of AI systems benefit most from TML?
**A:** TML is especially critical for:
- **Healthcare AI**: Treatment recommendations, triage decisions, resource allocation
- **Autonomous vehicles**: Life-critical navigation decisions
- **Financial AI**: Loan approvals, risk assessment, algorithmic trading
- **Content moderation**: Balancing free speech with harm prevention
- **Criminal justice AI**: Sentencing recommendations, parole decisions
- **HR systems**: Hiring, promotion, performance evaluation
- Any AI making decisions affecting human welfare

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Q6: How do I implement Sacred Pause in my AI system?
**A:** Basic implementation follows this pattern:

```python
from tml_framework import TMLEngine, MoralContext

# Initialize TML engine
tml = TMLEngine(domain="healthcare")

# Evaluate ethical decision
context = MoralContext(
    action="treatment_recommendation",
    stakeholders=["patient", "family", "insurance"],
    potential_outcomes=outcomes_data
)

decision = tml.evaluate(context)

if decision.state == "SACRED_PAUSE":
    # Trigger enhanced review process
    escalate_to_ethics_board(decision.reasoning)
elif decision.state == "PROCEED":
    execute_action(decision.confidence)
else:  # STOP
    log_ethical_prohibition(decision.concerns)
```

### Q7: What are the computational requirements for TML?
**A:** TML is designed to be lightweight:
- **Memory**: ~10MB for core engine
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead (<1% for most decisions)
- **Latency**: Typically <100ms for evaluation
- **Storage**: Audit logs ~1KB per decision
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of decisions/day

The Sacred Pause mechanism adds negligible computational cost while providing immense ethical value.

### Q8: Can TML work with existing ML/AI frameworks?
**A:** **Yes!** TML integrates seamlessly with:
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: As an ethical evaluation layer
- **Scikit-learn**: For decision validation
- **Hugging Face**: For LLM moral reasoning
- **Cloud platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure AI services
- **Edge computing**: Lightweight enough for IoT devices

Example integrations provided in `examples/integrations/`.

### Q9: How do I set Sacred Pause thresholds?
**A:** Thresholds are domain-specific but follow these guidelines:

```python
thresholds = {
    "moral_complexity": 0.7,      # Competing principles
    "stakeholder_conflict": 0.6,   # Divergent interests
    "novel_situation": 0.8,        # Lack of precedent
    "potential_harm": 0.5,         # Risk to vulnerable groups
    "reversibility": 0.4           # Difficulty of undoing
}
```

Calibrate based on your domain's error tolerance and regulatory requirements.

### Q10: What happens during a Sacred Pause?
**A:** The Sacred Pause triggers a defined escalation protocol:

1. **Immediate**: System logs pause reason and context
2. **Notification**: Relevant stakeholders alerted
3. **Enhancement**: Additional data/perspectives gathered
4. **Review**: Human expert or ethics board evaluation
5. **Decision**: Informed judgment with full documentation
6. **Learning**: Update system based on resolution

This process can be synchronous or asynchronous based on urgency.
