## Core Framework

### Q1: What is the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework?
TML is an enforcement framework for AI accountability that generates legal evidence when AI systems make ethically complex decisions. The framework creates immutable audit trails for investigation when AI causes harm, enabling criminal prosecution and victim compensation.

### Q2: What is the Sacred Pause?
The Sacred Pause is a logging trigger that generates comprehensive moral reasoning documentation when AI risk levels exceed organizational thresholds. It creates court-admissible evidence while AI systems continue operating normally.

### Q3: What are the three states of TML?
- **+1 (Proceed)**: Low risk, minimal logging required
- **0 (Sacred Pause)**: Risk threshold exceeded, comprehensive logging triggered
- **-1 (Prohibit)**: Automatic blocking of high-risk actions

### Q4: Does TML slow down AI performance?
No. Logs are generated in background after AI responses. Users receive immediate responses while audit trails are created asynchronously for future investigation needs.

## Legal Framework

### Q5: What legal penalties enforce TML compliance?
- **False attestation**: 5 years imprisonment
- **Log tampering**: 20 years imprisonment  
- **Missing logs**: Irrebuttable presumption of maximum fault
- **Financial penalties**: Percentage of global revenue per incident
- **Executive liability**: Personal criminal charges for violations

### Q6: Are TML logs useful in court?
Yes. Logs are specifically designed for legal admissibility with cryptographic signatures, immutable storage, and expert testimony from council institutions. Missing logs create irrebuttable presumption of organizational guilt.

### Q7: How does the Memorial Fund help AI negligence victims?
The Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund allocates 30% of resources to victim support:
- Emergency financial assistance for medical care
- Legal representation for AI negligence cases
- Expert testimony on missing TML safeguards
- Investigation support proving AI system failures

## Technical Implementation

### Q8: How do I implement TML in my AI system?
```python
from tml_framework import TMLEngine

# Initialize (organization sets thresholds)
tml = TMLEngine(
    sacred_pause_threshold=0.4,  # Your threshold
    prohibition_threshold=0.8
)

def ai_decision(query, context):
    # Calculate risk
    sprl = tml.calculate_sprl(query, context)
    
    # Check prohibition
    if sprl >= 0.8:
        return tml.block_action("Risk too high")
    
    # AI responds immediately
    response = ai_system.process(query)
    
    # Background logging if threshold exceeded
    if sprl >= 0.4:
        tml.generate_moral_trace_async(query, context, sprl)
    
    return response
```

### Q9: Who is responsible for SPRL calculations?
Organizations have complete responsibility. TML provides methodology only - companies must implement correctly and face full liability for:
- Proper SPRL calculation
- Appropriate threshold setting
- Accurate risk assessment
- Compliance with requirements

TML creators bear no responsibility for implementation failures.

### Q10: Are TML logs immutable?
Yes, completely tamper-proof:
- Cryptographic signing with HSM/TPM hardware
- Blockchain anchoring every 1000 entries
- WORM storage compliance required
- Any tampering invalidates entire audit trail
- Criminal penalties for log modification

### Q11: How do categorized logs save storage space?
Pattern recognition enables 90% storage reduction:
- Common scenarios stored as reusable templates
- Similar cases reference templates instead of full logs
- First instance: 500 bytes, subsequent: 45 bytes
- Complete audit capability maintained despite optimization

### Q12: When do logs become more detailed?
Higher risk triggers enhanced logging:
- High SPRL (>0.7): Comprehensive stakeholder analysis
- Vulnerable populations: Enhanced protection documentation
- Novel scenarios: Full reasoning when no template exists
- Prohibition cases: Complete documentation when actions blocked

---

## Investigation and Access

### Q13: How do institutions access logs for investigation?
Structured investigation protocol:
- 11-institution governance council authorizes access
- Read-only viewing with cryptographic receipts
- Victim legal representatives can request relevant logs
- Court subpoenas for AI negligence litigation
- Time-limited access expiring after case resolution

### Q14: How does TML create transparency instead of "black box" AI?
Complete "glass box" visibility:
- Every decision documented with reasoning
- Stakeholder impact clearly visible
- Risk calculations fully transparent
- Investigation access for any decision
- Democratic oversight through audit trails

AI decision-making becomes completely explainable and accountable.

- Lower risk thresholds (â‰¤0.25 for Sacred Pause)
- Enhanced documentation requirements
- Expedited investigation access
- Specialized legal protection
- Memorial fund priority support
