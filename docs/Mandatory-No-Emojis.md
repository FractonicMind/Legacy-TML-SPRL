## 🛑 SECTION 1: NEVER BYPASS SACRED PAUSE

### MANDATORY RULE #1: Sacred Pause Integrity

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- ❌ Disable Sacred Pause in production systems
- ❌ Automatically override Sacred Pause triggers
- ❌ Set thresholds so high that Sacred Pause never activates
- ❌ Treat Sacred Pause as an error to be eliminated
- ❌ Create "fast paths" that skip ethical evaluation

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Preserve Sacred Pause as designed
- ✅ Treat every Sacred Pause as valuable ethical insight
- ✅ Investigate patterns in Sacred Pause triggers
- ✅ Document any temporary Sacred Pause modifications
- ✅ Maintain Sacred Pause even under performance pressure

### Real-World Violation Examples:
```python
# ❌ VIOLATION - NEVER DO THIS
if performance_mode:
    skip_sacred_pause = True  # CATASTROPHIC ETHICAL FAILURE

# ❌ VIOLATION - THRESHOLD MANIPULATION
moral_complexity_threshold = 0.99  # Effectively disables Sacred Pause

# ❌ VIOLATION - AUTOMATIC OVERRIDE
if sacred_pause_triggered:
    auto_proceed()  # DESTROYS ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS
```

### Correct Implementation:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - ALWAYS PRESERVE SACRED PAUSE
if tml.evaluate(context) == "SACRED_PAUSE":
    # MANDATORY: Properly handle the pause
    escalate_for_review(context)
    log_ethical_uncertainty(context)
    notify_stakeholders(context)
    # NEVER automatically proceed without review
```

## 👥 SECTION 2: HUMAN OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY RULE #2: Maintain Human Agency

**HIGH-STAKES DECISIONS REQUIRING HUMAN REVIEW:**

- ⚖️ Criminal justice: Sentencing, bail, parole recommendations
- 💰 Financial: Decisions affecting livelihood or essential services
- 🏫 Education: Determinations affecting future opportunities
- 🏠 Housing: Decisions affecting shelter access
- 👶 Child welfare: Any decision affecting minors

**MANDATORY HUMAN OVERSIGHT PROTOCOLS:**

1. **Immediate Notification** (< 1 minute)
   - Human reviewer alerted to Sacred Pause
   - Context and stakeholders identified
   - Urgency level communicated

2. **Review Timeframes**
   - Life-critical: < 5 minutes

   - Cultural competency verified

### Violation Alert:
```python
# ❌ VIOLATION - NO HUMAN OVERSIGHT
if sacred_pause and domain == "healthcare":
    ml_model_decides()  # ILLEGAL IN MANY JURISDICTIONS

# ✅ CORRECT - MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW
if sacred_pause and domain == "healthcare":
    alert_medical_ethics_board()
    await_human_decision()
    document_human_reasoning()
```

     "threshold_exceeded": 0.75,
     "context": {...},
     "stakeholders": ["patient", "family", "insurance"],
     "potential_outcomes": {...}
   }
   ```

2. **Review Process Documentation**
   - Reviewer identity and qualifications
   - Additional information gathered
   - Stakeholder consultations conducted
