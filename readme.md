## Framework Status

**Documentation**: ✅ Updated to post-audit investigation model  
**Python Implementation**: ⚠️ Requires conversion from pre-approval to logging model  
**Interactive Demo**: ⚠️ Reflects old pre-approval model  
**Repository Navigation**: ⚠️ Needs updating to current structure

## Abstract

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) implements mandatory transparency infrastructure for artificial intelligence systems through Sacred Pause logging when organizations' configured thresholds trigger. The framework provides comprehensive audit trails without mandating specific processing times or risk levels, enabling post-incident investigation while maintaining organizational autonomy over operational decisions.

Through separation of infrastructure provision from risk calibration, TML eliminates framework liability while ensuring accountability. Organizations determine their Stakeholder Proportional Risk Level (SPRL) thresholds for triggering Sacred Pause, while TML provides the logging mechanism creating categorized moral traces for investigation when ethical issues arise.

The framework addresses storage concerns through pattern recognition achieving 90% reduction after initial learning phase. Real-world costs demonstrate feasibility: 1 billion decisions require approximately 100GB storage, costing $2.30/month at current cloud rates.

## PUBLIC INTEREST DECLARATION: Engineering Accountability Into AI

### The Governance-Implementation Gap

Current regulatory frameworks establish principles without implementation:

**EU AI Act**: Mandates "transparency" without specifying logging architecture  
**NIST AI RMF**: Recommends "risk management" without defining evidence requirements  
**GDPR Article 22**: Requires "explanation" without technical standards

These frameworks resemble building codes mandating "safe structures" without specifying load requirements or inspection protocols.

### TML: From Principle to Practice

TML transforms abstract governance into concrete engineering:

**Instead of**: "AI should be transparent"  
**TML Provides**: Sacred Pause triggers generate categorized moral traces with stakeholder analysis

**Instead of**: "AI should be accountable"  
**TML Provides**: Immutable audit trails accessible to authorized institutions for investigation

**Instead of**: "AI should protect vulnerable populations"  
**TML Provides**: Enhanced logging with specific vulnerability assessment when protected groups affected

### The Historical Parallel

Consider previous technological accountability:
- **Aviation**: Black boxes mandated after crashes revealed investigation impossibility
- **Finance**: Audit trails mandated after fraud destroyed economies
- **Automobiles**: Safety standards mandated after preventable deaths accumulated

AI currently operates without equivalent accountability infrastructure. TML provides this before catastrophic failure forces hasty implementation.

### Public Interest Reality

Citizens should understand: AI systems making decisions about employment, healthcare, finances, and freedom currently operate without mandatory transparency. No law requires documenting their reasoning. No regulation ensures investigation capability when harm occurs.

TML changes this through engineering mandate, not philosophical aspiration. The framework exists for when society demands accountability - not forcing adoption today, but ensuring infrastructure exists when needed.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Work

**Documentation Architecture** (✅ Complete):
- MANDATORY.md: Updated to post-audit investigation model
- GENERAL_FAQ.md: Converted to transparency infrastructure
- LICENSE_FAQ.md: Aligned with current model
- QUICK_START.md: Rewritten for logging without delays
- ACADEMIC_VALIDATION.md: Updated for investigation protocols
- All governance documents: Aligned with post-audit model

**Core Concept Transformation**:
- Sacred Pause: From operational delay to logging trigger
- SPRL: From mandatory calculation to organizational control
- Investigation: From pre-approval to post-incident
- Processing: From 40μs mandate to organizational optimization

### Work Required

**Python Implementation** (🔧 Needs Conversion):
All .py files require transformation from pre-approval to logging model:

```python
# OLD MODEL (needs removal):
wait_for_institutional_approval()
pause_until_review()
escalate_to_human()

# NEW MODEL (needs implementation):
generate_moral_trace()
store_immutable_log()
provide_investigation_access()
```

**Key Files Requiring Update**:
- `implementations/python-library/core.py`: Core framework logic
- `examples/*.py`: All example implementations
- `eval/backends/sacred_pause.py`: Evaluation framework
- `benchmark/*.py`: Performance testing
- `tests/*.py`: Test suites

**Repository Navigation**:
- Update `repository-navigation.html` to reflect current structure
- Remove references to deleted approval mechanisms
- Add new investigation infrastructure documentation

---

## Technical Architecture

### Mandatory Infrastructure Components

**Sacred Pause Logging**:
```python
class TMLFramework:
    """
    Organizations control when Sacred Pause triggers
    TML ensures logs are created when it does
    """
    
    def __init__(self, organization_config):
        # Organization determines
        self.sprl_threshold = organization_config['sprl_threshold']
        
        # TML mandates
        self.logging_capability = True  # Cannot be disabled
        self.audit_immutable = True  # Cannot be modified
        
    def process_decision(self, context):
        # Organization's risk assessment
        if self.should_calculate_risk(context):
            risk = self.calculate_sprl(context)
            
            if risk >= self.sprl_threshold:
                # MANDATORY: Create log when triggered
                trace = self.create_moral_trace(context, risk)
                self.store_immutable_log(trace)
        
        # AI proceeds without delay
        return self.ai_decision(context)
```

### Storage Optimization

**Pattern Recognition System**:
- Initial occurrence: ~500 bytes (full documentation)
- Repeated pattern: ~45 bytes (template reference)
- Storage reduction: 90% after learning phase
- Annual cost for 1B decisions: ~$28/year

### Investigation Architecture

Pre-authorized institutions access logs for post-incident investigation without operational control. See [TML-GOVERNANCE.md] for institutional structure.

## Why Organizations Will Implement TML

### Legal Protection Through Documentation
When incidents occur, organizations with TML logs demonstrate due diligence. Organizations without logs face presumption of negligence. Courts increasingly recognize absence of documentation as evidence of inadequate care.

### Training Data Value
TML logs provide moral reasoning patterns that don't currently exist in production systems:
- Systematic bias detection
- Edge case documentation
- Risk calibration refinement
- Ethical reasoning patterns

This unprecedented data provides competitive advantage for AI improvement.

### Regulatory Alignment
TML operationalizes existing regulations:
- GDPR Article 22: Right to explanation fulfilled through logs
- EU AI Act: Transparency obligations met via audit trails
- NIST AI RMF: Risk management documented
- Sector regulations: Evidence for compliance

### Economic Reality
- Implementation: 40-160 developer hours (less than GDPR)
- Storage: $2.30/month per billion decisions
- Compare to: Average AI discrimination lawsuit exceeds $1M

## The Reality of Adoption

TML faces predictable resistance. Organizations will claim it's too complex, too expensive, violates competitive advantage. These are the same arguments made against every accountability measure in history.

The framework doesn't need voluntary adoption. It needs to exist when involuntary adoption becomes necessary. When AI causes sufficient harm that public outcry demands transparency, TML provides ready infrastructure.

Current AI operates as a black box. No logs exist when harm occurs. No evidence for investigation. No accountability possible. TML changes this by creating evidence at the moment of decision, not scrambling for explanation after harm.

---

## Conclusion

TML provides transparency infrastructure that organizations will resist until they can't. The framework separates infrastructure from control - TML provides logging capability, organizations decide when to use it. This protects both framework and implementers from inappropriate liability while ensuring accountability mechanisms exist.

The technical challenges are solved. Storage is affordable through categorization. Processing overhead is manageable without time mandates. Investigation access preserves organizational autonomy. The only barrier is willingness.

This framework exists as preparation for inevitability. AI systems will cause harm. Public pressure will demand accountability. Regulations will require transparency. When that moment arrives, TML provides the technical architecture ready for implementation.
