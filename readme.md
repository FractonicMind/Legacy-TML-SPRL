## The Three States of Moral Reasoning (CORE INNOVATION)

```python
# THIS IS THE HEART OF TML
class TernaryMoralLogic:
    def evaluate(self, context):
        sprl = self.calculate_sprl(context)
        
        if sprl >= 0.8:  # State -1: PROHIBIT
            self.block_action()
            self.log_prohibition()
            return -1
            
        elif sprl >= 0.3:  # State 0: SACRED PAUSE (LOGGING TRIGGER)
            # THIS IS THE INNOVATION - NOT A DELAY BUT EVIDENCE GENERATION
            self.generate_comprehensive_moral_trace()
            self.create_justification_object()
            self.store_immutable_log()
            return 0  # Continue execution with full documentation
            
        else:  # State +1: PROCEED
            self.minimal_logging()
            return 1
```

**Critical Understanding**:
- Sacred Pause is NOT a pause/delay
- It's a LOGGING TRIGGER when risk detected
- Generates court-admissible evidence
- Organizations set thresholds but can't game them (≤0.5 for high-risk)

---

## Enforcement Mechanisms (REAL TEETH)

### Legal Presumptions
- **Missing Logs = Automatic Guilt**: Irrebuttable presumption of maximum fault
- **Burden Reversal**: Organization must prove compliance
- **Strict Liability**: No excuses for missing Sacred Pause logs

### Criminal Penalties
- **False Attestation**: 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (5 years imprisonment)
- **Log Tampering**: 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (20 years imprisonment)
- **Threshold Gaming**: Fraud charges with treble damages

### Whistleblower Protection
- **Qui Tam Rewards**: 15-30% of collected penalties
- **Minimum Guarantee**: 10x median annual income
- **Anti-Retaliation**: $5M minimum fine + criminal charges

### Financial Penalties
- **Per Incident**: 10% global revenue or 2% market cap (whichever greater)
- **Insurance Required**: 100x median income × affected parties
- **Executive Personal**: 10% of company coverage

## Key Technical Specifications

### SPRL Calculation
```python
SPRL = Σ(wi * fi) where:
- wi = weight of factor i (Σwi = 1)
- fi = factor score (0 ≤ fi ≤ 1)
Factors: stakeholder_impact, vulnerability, reversibility, scale, precedent
```

### Prohibition Thresholds (Quantified)
- **Discrimination**: >15% disparate impact (four-fifths rule)
- **Manipulation**: >0.7 on Cambridge scale
- **Safety**: >2σ deviation from baseline
- **Democratic**: >0.3 electoral influence
- **Minors**: >0.5 developmental impact

### Storage Requirements
- **Initial**: ~500 bytes per decision
- **After categorization**: ~45 bytes (90% reduction)
- **Annual cost**: ~$28 per billion decisions

---

## Critical Reminders for Implementation

1. **Sacred Pause threshold ≤0.5 for high-risk systems** - No gaming allowed
2. **Logs must be cryptographically signed** - HSM/TPM required
3. **Blockchain anchoring every 1000 entries** - Immutability proof
4. **Vulnerable populations get enhanced protection** - Lower thresholds
5. **Whistleblower system must be anonymous** - Tor hidden service recommended
6. **Executive attestations quarterly** - Personal criminal liability
7. **Independent audits via lottery** - No auditor shopping
8. **Missing logs = irrebuttable presumption** - No defense possible

---

## What Makes This Framework Unstoppable

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: MANDATORY.md answers EVERY question
2. **Legal Integration**: Aligns with EU AI Act, GDPR, US liability law
3. **Technical Feasibility**: Proven patterns, realistic costs
4. **Economic Viability**: $28/year for billion decisions vs $1M+ lawsuit
5. **Gaming Prevention**: Statistical detection, fraud prosecution
6. **Public Pressure**: Whistleblower rewards ensure exposure
7. **Executive Fear**: Personal criminal liability for false attestation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create core implementation files** (see checklist above)
2. **Build FastAPI reference application**
3. **Develop test suites for compliance validation**
4. **Update repository-navigation.html**
5. **Create final readme.md** (after implementation complete)

## Working Notes

### From Gemini Analysis
- Need stronger prescriptive SPRL methodology
- Stakeholder mapping needs specific techniques
- Technical architecture requires forensic standards
- Performance engineering needs concrete patterns
- Governance requires operational detail
- Bias monitoring needs structured process

### Implementation Priority
1. Core three-state engine (tml_core.py)
2. SPRL calculator with full methodology
3. Sacred Pause trigger mechanism
4. Moral trace generator
5. Cryptographic infrastructure
6. Storage system with categorization

### Repository Health
- Current: Mix of old "post-audit" and new "enforcement" language
- Needed: Consistent enforcement framework throughout
- Action: Systematic file review and update
