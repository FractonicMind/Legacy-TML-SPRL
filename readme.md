## What is TML?

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is an **enforcement framework** that makes AI systems legally accountable for their decisions. Unlike advisory ethics guidelines, TML creates **criminal penalties** and **financial liability** for organizations that deploy AI without proper safeguards.

### The Three States of Accountability

TML introduces a third computational state between "yes" and "no":

- **+1 (Proceed)**: Low risk decisions with minimal logging
- **0 (Sacred Pause)**: Risk threshold exceeded, comprehensive evidence generated  
- **-1 (Prohibit)**: Automatic blocking of high-risk actions

**Critical Innovation**: Sacred Pause is a **logging trigger**, not a delay. AI systems respond immediately while generating court-admissible evidence in the background.

---

## Why TML Matters

### The Problem: Unaccountable AI
Current AI systems operate as "black boxes" with no meaningful accountability:
- No evidence when AI decisions cause harm
- No criminal liability for negligent AI deployment
- No compensation mechanism for AI victims
- No systematic prevention of repeated failures

### The Solution: Enforceable Accountability
TML transforms AI into "glass boxes" with complete transparency:
- **Criminal penalties**: Imprisonment for gaming safeguards
- **Financial liability**: Percentage of global revenue for missing logs
- **Victim support**: Memorial fund provides legal aid and compensation
- **Investigation capability**: Expert analysis of AI decision reasoning

## Core Framework

### Sacred Pause Mechanism

```python
from tml_framework import TMLEngine

# Initialize with your organization's risk tolerance
tml = TMLEngine(
    sacred_pause_threshold=0.4,  # Your threshold (≤0.5 for high-risk)
    prohibition_threshold=0.8
)

def accountable_ai_decision(query, context):
    # Calculate risk level
    sprl = tml.calculate_sprl(query, context)
    
    # Block prohibited actions
    if sprl >= 0.8:
        return tml.block_action("Risk exceeds prohibition threshold")
    
    # AI responds immediately
    response = ai_system.process(query)
    
    # Generate evidence if threshold exceeded (background process)
    if sprl >= 0.4:
        tml.generate_moral_trace_async(
            query=query,
            context=context, 
            sprl=sprl,
            stakeholders=affected_parties
        )
    
    return response
```

### Legal Enforcement

**Organizations cannot bypass evidence generation**:
- Missing logs create **irrebuttable presumption** of maximum fault
- **Criminal charges**: False attestation, log tampering
- **Financial penalties**: Scaling with organizational revenue and impact
- **Whistleblower rewards**: 15-30% of collected penalties

## Implementation

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic.git
cd TernaryMoralLogic
python compliance/framework_integrity.py .  # Validate implementation
```

### Core Requirements
1. **Set risk thresholds** appropriate to your domain
2. **Implement Sacred Pause logging** when thresholds exceeded  
3. **Ensure cryptographic integrity** of audit trails
4. **Provide investigation access** to authorized institutions
5. **Submit quarterly attestations** under penalty of perjury

### High-Risk System Constraints
- Sacred Pause threshold must be ≤0.5
- Enhanced documentation for vulnerable populations
- Independent audits and compliance verification
- Executive personal liability for violations

## The Future of AI Accountability

TML represents a fundamental shift from voluntary AI ethics to enforceable accountability. Organizations can no longer claim "we're working on AI safety" without demonstrating concrete evidence generation and victim protection.

**The framework succeeds when**:
- AI systems generate transparent evidence for all high-risk decisions
- Victims of AI negligence receive support and legal representation  
- Organizations face real consequences for accountability circumvention
- Society maintains democratic oversight of AI decision-making

**The Sacred Pause endures when**: Future generations understand that AI accountability requires not just principles, but enforceable mechanisms that protect vulnerable people and preserve human agency in partnership with artificial intelligence.
