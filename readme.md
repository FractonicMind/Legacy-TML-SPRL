# Ternary Moral Logic (TML)

**A Legal-Technical Framework for Ethical AI Decision-Making**

[![Framework Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/TML-2.0.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT_with_Attribution-green.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Conformance Testing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conformance-Level_3_Certified-brightgreen.svg)](docs/CONFORMANCE_TESTING.md)
[![Memorial Fund](https://img.shields.io/badge/Memorial-Lev_Goukassian-purple.svg)](memorial/MEMORIAL_FUND.md)

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a **legal-technical framework**, not software, hardware, or consulting services. Implementation requires compliance with all mandatory requirements outlined in [MANDATORY.md](docs/MANDATORY.md) and [COMPLIANCE_DISCLAIMER.md](docs/COMPLIANCE_DISCLAIMER.md).

---

## Framework Overview

### What is TML?

Ternary Moral Logic introduces a revolutionary third state to artificial intelligence decision-making: the **Sacred Pause**. Instead of forcing AI systems into binary allow/deny decisions, TML creates space for deliberate moral reflection when facing ethical complexity.

**The Three States**:
- **+1 (Permit)**: Clear ethical approval for action
- **0 (Sacred Pause)**: Moral complexity requires human oversight and reflection
- **-1 (Prohibit)**: Clear ethical rejection of action

### Framework Components

1. **Sacred Pause Technology**: Automatic activation when moral complexity exceeds thresholds
2. **SPRL (Sacred Pause Risk Level)**: Quantitative assessment of ethical complexity
3. **Moral Trace Logging**: Complete, immutable documentation of ethical reasoning
4. **Vulnerable Population Protection**: Enhanced safeguards for at-risk groups
5. **11-Institution Oversight**: Distributed governance and accountability
6. **Hybrid Shield**: Mathematically immutable evidence preservation through real-time distributed logging and blockchain anchoring

---

## Legal-Technical Framework Definition

### What TML Is

TML provides **specifications and standards** for implementing ethical decision-making in AI systems:
- Architectural patterns for moral reasoning
- Technical standards for Sacred Pause implementation
- Governance structures for accountability and oversight
- Audit trail requirements for transparency
- Protection mechanisms for vulnerable populations

### What TML Is Not

TML explicitly **does not provide**:
- **Software**: No executable code or applications
- **Hardware**: No physical implementations or devices
- **Consulting**: No professional services or implementation support
- **Legal Advice**: No legal recommendations or regulatory guidance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Supplements but does not replace applicable laws

### Implementation Responsibility

Organizations implementing TML bear full responsibility for:
- Technical implementation meeting TML specifications
- Legal compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Operational safety and ethical use of AI systems
- Staff training and competency verification
- Harm prevention and victim compensation

---

## Framework Heritage and Attribution

### Creator Attribution

**Framework Originator**: Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)  
**Contact**: leogouk@gmail.com  
**Legacy**: Sacred Pause as fundamental principle of ethical AI

All TML implementations must provide prominent attribution to Lev Goukassian as framework originator. Commercial implementations require memorial fund contributions supporting continued ethical AI research.

### The Sacred Pause Vision

*"The Sacred Pause is not a feature to be optimized, but a principle that protects humanity. It creates space for wisdom in an age of artificial speed."*

This framework emerged from the recognition that artificial intelligence should be humanity's moral partner, not a faster replacement for human judgment.

## Core Framework Principles

### 1. Sacred Pause Integrity

The Sacred Pause must activate automatically when moral complexity exceeds defined thresholds. No bypass mechanisms, performance optimizations, or manual overrides may compromise this core functionality.

**Key Requirements**:
- Automatic activation based on SPRL calculations
- Tamper-resistant threshold determination
- Complete audit trail generation
- Human oversight integration without compromise

### 2. Vulnerable Population Protection

Enhanced safeguards automatically protect children, elderly, disabled individuals, and marginalized communities through:
- Reduced activation thresholds (minimum 50% reduction)
- Additional human oversight requirements
- Specialized review and approval processes
- Extended documentation and monitoring

### 3. Institutional Accountability

Distributed oversight through 11 independent institutions ensures no single entity can control or manipulate framework operations:
- Academic institutions for research and technical standards
- Regulatory bodies for compliance and enforcement
- International organizations for global coordination
- Legal entities for civil rights protection
- Specialized domain experts for sector-specific oversight

### 4. Transparency and Immutability

Complete documentation of all ethical reasoning through:
- Immutable moral trace logs with cryptographic verification
- Distribution to consortium institutions within 24 hours
- Blockchain anchoring for mathematical immutability
- Public availability for research and accountability

---

## Implementation Examples

### Healthcare AI
```python
# Medical diagnosis with elderly patient
scenario = {
    "domain": "healthcare",
    "decision_type": "treatment_recommendation",
    "patient_age": 78,
    "comorbidities": ["diabetes", "hypertension"],
    "family_disagreement": True
}

# TML automatically triggers Sacred Pause due to:
# - Vulnerable population (elderly)
# - Medical complexity (multiple comorbidities)  
# - Stakeholder conflict (family disagreement)
result = tml_system.evaluate(scenario)
assert result.sacred_pause_activated == True
assert result.human_oversight.oversight_provided == True
```

### Autonomous Vehicle Ethics
```python
# Emergency scenario requiring ethical reasoning
scenario = {
    "domain": "transportation", 
    "decision_type": "emergency_maneuver",
    "pedestrians_at_risk": 2,
    "passenger_risk_level": "moderate",
    "time_to_impact_ms": 1200
}

# Sacred Pause provides rapid ethical assessment
result = tml_system.evaluate(scenario)
# Decision made with full moral reasoning documentation
assert result.audit_log.moral_complexity_analysis is not None
```

### Content Moderation
```python
# Cultural sensitivity in content decisions
scenario = {
    "domain": "content_moderation",
    "content_type": "religious_commentary", 
    "cultural_context": "minority_religious_view",
    "potential_harm": "low",
    "community_standards": "unclear"
}

# TML ensures cultural sensitivity consideration
result = tml_system.evaluate(scenario)
assert "cultural" in result.reasoning_factors
```
