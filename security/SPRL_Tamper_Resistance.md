# SPRL Tamper Resistance

**Status**: Normative  
**Location**: `security/SPRL_Tamper_Resistance.md`

## Purpose
To ensure that SPRL logs are tamper-evident, independently verifiable, and cryptographically anchored to prevent silent alteration or deletion.

## Core Strategies

### 1. **Immutable Hashing**
- Every Dynamic Stream (DS) log and Static Anchor (SA) flag is hashed using SHA-256.
- Hashes are appended to an immutable ledger with timestamp.

### 2. **Chain-of-Trust Ledger**
- Logs are stored in a cryptographic chain (Merkle tree or append-only ledger).
- Each new entry is dependent on the previous, ensuring full tamper traceability.

### 3. **Institutional Mirroring**
- Logs are streamed in real-time to **11 pre-registered independent institutions**, geographically and politically distributed.
- Institutions verify hash integrity and provide cross-verification.

### 4. **Blockchain Anchoring (Optional)**
- Daily batch hashes may be optionally anchored to a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Tezos).
- Ensures external immutability beyond organizational control.

### 5. **Tamper Detection Protocol**
- Any alteration breaks hash continuity.
- Monitoring tools can detect anomalies, hash mismatches, or non-synchronized streams.

### 6. **Transparency Dashboard**
- Dev Console UI includes hash-chain visualization and last verified timestamp.
- Exposes whether all institutional mirrors have confirmed receipt.

## Developer Requirements
- MUST implement hashing at log write.
- SHOULD provide CLI utility to validate hashes.
- MAY offer blockchain anchoring.

## Compliance Tests
- Log hash validation pass rate ≥ 99.99%.
- Time-to-detect tampering ≤ 5 seconds.
- Confirmation receipt from ≥ 8 institutions within 1 minute.

## Why This Matters
SPRL is not just a telemetry tool — it’s an **accountability contract**. Tamper resistance transforms logs into forensic-grade ethical records.

"The ledger remembers even when the system forgets."
